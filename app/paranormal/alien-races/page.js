	    <p>Human Looking</p>
<p>1)
   This section covers all aspects of human looking extraterrestrials. This includes inter-dimensional entities, the Blond species,
   and aliens masquerading as humans. Although human-looking extraterrestrials generally appear to be benevolent towards humanity,
   there are many that have been influenced, controlled, or possessed by malevolent beings.
</p>
<p>2) Any apparent alien who
   is essentially human and Caucasian in appearance, even though sometimes very tall, may be called a Blond. Though many are
   tall, blond-haired, and blue-eyed, certainly all are not. Even some of the American Indian connection may be considered Blond
   in origin. There are many factions of these aliens, from different places, with different motivations.
</p>
<p>2.1.1.1 Andromedians</p>
<p>1)
   There is a great force of entities coming from the Andromeda Galaxy. These are inter-stellar entities that go in light. Their
   craft have the ability to go in hyper-light so that, in only a matter of moments, they can be here from an entirely different
   star system.
</p>
<p>2) These entities are very beautiful. They are lithely built and very thin. This race is so spiritually
   evolved that they no longer require a physical body. They are almost beings of light energy. They are illuminated in light.
   They are very tall and stand eight to ten feet in height. In mythology, they were referred to as the Winged Gods.
</p>
<p>3)
   Their biological system is based entirely different than our genetic system. These entities display an embodiment that is
   magnetized in light. They do not eat. They gain knowledge. They live off of "Prona" which is an ancient term meaning truth.
</p>
<p>4)
   They are beautiful beyond description and mankind shadows fragments of that beauty. They have taken care of humanity because
   they consider us as their brothers and sisters. They believe that we all came from the same source and that we were all created
   in light. It is the common bond between us.
</p>
<p>5) They have a very great Mother Ship. At night, it is invisible because
   of the metal that it is made out of. It looks black. But, if it were to light up, it would be the sun illuminated 10,000 times.
   It is here in our stratosphere. It moves quietly and stealthily. Our government is aware of its presence and it is ominous
   to them.
</p>
<p>6) This ship is called Miria Amour. It means the silver light. The ship has warriors that would defy imagination.
   It can blast a continent to the bottom of the sea. It could rotate our planet and send it spinning out of orbit. The ship
   is here because of the disease on this planet. It is here because of the collapse of consciousness of civilization. It is
   here also because of the changes that are going to occur here. And, it is here because of another force that is engaged on
   this planet.
</p>
<p>7) These beings have inspired profits, in the past, to do wonderful things and preserve the seeds of humanity.
   Its truth and its words have been misused, misconstrued, and taken by powerful men to enslave people. And, it has been allowed.
   But, these entities are back now for truth.
</p>
<p>2.1.1.2 Pleiadians</p>
<p>1) The Pleiadians come from a small cluster of
   stars called the Pleiades. Of the seven stars, which make up the Pleiades cluster in the Taurus Constellation, the Pleiadians
   come from the star known as Taygeta. There are nine planets that revolve around Taygeta. Four of these planets are inhabited.
</p>
<p>2)
   The Pleiadian's home world is the planet Erra, which is very similar to Earth, being only ten percent smaller. Nature there
   is also very similar, especially since samples of plants, minerals, and animals have been taken to the Pleiades and developed
   there. The surface gravity is slightly less than on Earth. A day on Erra is six tenths of a second less than on Earth.
</p>
<p>3)
   The Pleiadians are humans with few physical differences. Their skin is whiter than humans as a result of higher evolution.
   They are several million years older than humanity. The Pleiadians live a more spiritual life style. This means that they
   are experiencing and learning more with their spiritual senses than with their material senses. There are no medical problems.
   They are able to control their health through psychic balance. The life span for a Pleiadian is more than 700 years. The ability
   to project thoughts to another place on the planet is very common and is the socially accepted method of visiting.
</p>
<p>4)
   Only 400 million people live on Erra. Population control has come about in a desire to keep their society spread out and able
   to share the resources of the planet equally. Pleiadians on Erra live in a utopian world free of pollution, war, hunger, and
   disease thanks to advanced technology and spiritual awareness.
</p>
<p>5) Because the population communicates by telepathy,
   there is no dishonesty. All basic necessities are provided freely, and anything beyond that is acquired through individual
   barter. There is no money and, hence, no irrational grasping for wealth and power. The Pleiadians have no economics, but do
   have a system of sharing the resources of their world. Material possessions are all provided, based on their contribution
   to the community.
</p>
<p>6) There are no large cities with towering buildings as on Earth. But instead, the small population
   of Erra is spread out into smaller communities that span the planet, connected by a series of sentient tubeways that not only
   transport the population but educate and inform them along the way. The people live in more rural settings and keep a distance
   from each other. 
</p>
<p>7) Nearly all of the manufacturing and production of products for living is done on other planets
   in their solar system so as to not upset the ecology on Erra. They have long since developed a balance with nature that is
   well protected. The planet has a green atmosphere, which is controlled, and it contributes to their health and stressless
   way of life.
</p>
<p>8) What government is necessary is provided by a 'High Council' composed of the wisest and most evolved
   Pleiadians. Any changes to their social order must be approved by a vote of the highest percentage of the population. The
   Pleiadians are part of a federation of civilized worlds that live by the words of an advanced race in the Andromeda Galaxy.
</p>
<p>9)
   It is the desire of Pleiadians to stimulate the human consciousness through the dissemination of information so that humanity
   can make the necessary changes to create a new world based on Saalome, which is a Pleiadian word meaning 'peace in wisdom'.
</p>
<p>2.1.1.3
   Procyonians
</p>
<p>1) Procyonians have been nick-named 'Swedes' and are on the average between six and six and a half feet
   tall. They are from a solar system that revolves around Procyon, a binary yellow-white and yellow star system that rises before
   Sirius in Canis Minor (in the body of the Lesser Dog), about 11.4 light years from Earth. They are from the fourth planet
   in orbit around the Procyon double star system.
</p>
<p>2) These Blonds are muscular with slender necks and agile bodies. Their
   eyes are alert and of high intelligence. Physically they are almost identical to humans. The main difference is that by human
   standards their blood circulatory system is under-developed, while their lymphatic system is over-developed. This gives them
   stronger immune systems than terrestrial humans.
</p>
<p>3) Some Blonds have high intellectual and verbal abilities, while
   others are mute and telepathic. The Blonds with speech abilities will respond violently if attacked or threatened. But, the
   telepathic type will not. Both types are careful to avoid exposure, and usually encounter humans in quiet isolated places.
   They contact females more frequently. They may just stare and observe humans, then retreat. The Blonds do not seem to age,
   and consistently appear to be from 27 to 35 human years old, no matter what their real age may be.
</p>
<p>4) Sometimes Blonds
   are prisoners of the Grays. The Grays must paralyze or destroy their ability to teleport through time and other dimensions
   in order to take them prisoner. The Blonds that are seen on the same ships as the Grays, working with them, are hybrids or
   they are clones. One way to distinguish the clone is that they all look alike. The real Blonds have distinct facial feature
   differences, and do not look alike.
</p>
<p>5) The clones have thick necks and coarsely muscular bodies. They do not have the
   ability to teleport or to travel inter-dimensionally. They can be contacted by telepathy, but are unable to send. They can
   be given orders telepathically. They are zombie-like flesh robots. You can tell that they are of low intelligence by looking
   into their eyes.
</p>
<p>6) The tall Blonds from Procyon have a benign attitude toward humanity, except for their strong disapproval
   of our inhumanity to each other. This strong disapproval is further intensified by the fact that our government has made a
   secret alliance with their hereditary enemies, the Grays, in order to obtain even more destructive weapon systems than those
   that were already in existence. Our government is not interested in negotiating with the Procyonians, as they would not provide
   us with weapon systems.
</p>
<p>2.1.1.4 Aliens Masquerading as Humans</p>
<p>1) The purpose of aliens who masquerade as humans
   are so that they may perform certain activities on Earth without suspicion. These activities include the study of human development,
   the transfer of information to humanity, and the direct intervention and control of human activities for alien purposes. Aliens
   who have been acting in this manner include the following:
</p>
<p>* Pleiadeans - for benevolent study and spiritual development.</p>
<p>*
   Nordics - the nordic/arian race forefathers.
</p>
<p>* Koldasians - similar level of evolution.</p>
<p>* Ashtarians - for the
   advancement of religious dogma.
</p>
<p>* Gray controlled bio-drones, droids - to replace Earth's leaders</p>
<p>for social
   and economic control.
</p>
<p>* Gray controlled Men In Black, holograms, and projections</p>
<p>for
   mystical figures that appear to give divine guidance.
</p>
<p>2.1.2 Smooth Skinned Humanoids</p>
<p>1) Smooth skinned humanoids,
   presented in this section, include: the Tall Grays, the Short Grays, Human/Grey Interbreeds, Zeta Reticulans, Sirians, Insectoids,
   and others. These are all humanoid beings with a body that has a head, two arms, and two legs similar to the human body. However,
   these beings have a physiology that is obviously not human in nature.
</p>
<p>2.1.2.1 Tall Grays</p>
<p>1) Some of the various
   22 sub-species of Grays originally started out as tall blond-haired humanoids in the Rigel system, but were subject to heavy
   radiation due to a nuclear exchange over a long period of time, changing their DNA to the point where some of the species
   became stunted misshapen dwarves. Glandular structures were also affected, including reproductive and digestive organs. The
   nuclear exchange occurred approximately 300,000 years ago. This type of Gray species has been referred to as the "Orion Crusaders"
   or the "Markabians".
</p>
<p>2) There are two main types of the tall Gray species who call themselves the EBAN. Type 1 of the
   Orion Grays are about seven to eight feet tall and have what you would call an insect-base to their genetic makeup. They have
   a pronounced nose and slanted black eyes. They have no external genitalia and are extremely aggressive toward humans. Type
   2 of the tall Grays, are between six and seven feet tall and have external genitalia. This type appears to be a taller form
   of the short Gray species with similar large heads and large black eyes.
</p>
<p>3) The Grays operate very efficiently in the
   dark. Their eyes are more sensitive to ultraviolet light. They have the ability to control their heart rate. The normal heart
   rate for a Gray is above that of a human. The skin seems to have a metallic content and an unusual, cobalt pigmentation.
</p>
<p>4)
   The brain has been described as having many more lobes than the human brain. There have been previous references to crystalline
   networks that have been found in the brains of some of the alien autopsies. It is believed that the network has a functional
   relationship to telepathic communication and acts as a functional node for group control of the cloned species, which function
   in what is essentially a hive mind.
</p>
<p>5) They have problems with their glands, particularly with their sebaceous glands,
   which make it difficult for them to digest food. They derive nourishment from the glandular secretions and enzymes that they
   extract from animals that they mutilate. They absorb these extracts through the pores in their skin.
</p>
<p>6) The Gray species
   is not based on individualization or being an individual entity. For entities maintaining a group mind set (social memory
   complex), individualization seems to cause a great deal of random energy loss. They were initially fascinated with both human
   individuality and the human emotional spectrum, which they can perceive but apparently do not comprehend what it means (to
   humans).
</p>
<p>7) This species objectives appear to be founded on a rigid domination survival-based social order, where their
   "religion" is science, their social structure is geared to obedience, and their military concepts are grouped around conquest,
   colonization, and domination through covert mind control programs. It has become apparent that there are definite hierarchies
   within their social structures that provide for each entity having specific duties to perform.
</p>
<p>8) These beings have
   technological superiority, but they appear to be lacking in spiritual and social sciences. This is evident in their obvious
   lack of warmth, emotionality, and respect relative to humans. They can sometimes obtain momentary pleasure in terms of mood
   elevation by tuning in on human wavelengths via telepathically connected radionic devices. They react to intense human emotion
   such as ecstasy or agony. They blanket couples for sexual thrills and are drawn to aberrants and sexual deviates. The Markabs
   use sex, pain, drugs and fear as obsessive elements with which to aberrate humans.
</p>
<p>9) There appears to be much subtle
   conditioning that has helped prepare Earth people for certain aliens. However, it is now clear the aliens that have made technology
   available to the secret government are not benevolent but are our enemies, as they do the abductions, lie, deceive, are generally
   malevolent and are apparently implementing a very carefully planned covert invasion which includes the brutal and inhumane
   use of humans and animals for advanced genetic experimentation and crossbreeding.
</p>
<p>10) It is a strategy whereby the
   malevolent aliens are building an 'Faustian' alliance with the secret government to enable them to effectively claim the Earth
   for their own, with humanity's unwitting consent, before any other aliens are able to effect appropriate contact within the
   constraints of so called 'Universal Laws' to which other alien races supposedly adhere.
</p>
<p>11) The malevolent aliens have
   claimed their total authorship of the religions as a means to inculcate humanity's dependence and prospective allegiance to
   them and reverence of them. Their apparent behavior indicates an attempt to leverage that claimed authorship to their own
   benefit by placing themselves in the position of being 'Gods' or 'God's divine messengers'.
</p>
<p>2.1.2.2 Short Grays</p>
<p>1)
   The large Grays use smaller cloned, big-headed Grays to perform abduction and examination work. It is these Grays that abductees
   see most of the time. They are referred to as the Belletrax species from Betelgueses in the Orion Constellation.
</p>
<p>2)
   The Gray species in general is more on the order of an electronically based space society with a common social memory complex
   that allows them to collectively function as areas of group-mind. Groups of Grays are controlled from one central source being,
   usually one of the large Grays, a Blond humanoid, or other dominant species.
</p>
<p>3) The approximate height of the big-headed
   Gray is 3.5 to 4.5 feet tall, and have an average weight of about 40 pounds. Proportions of the head to the body are similar
   to a human five-month fetus. This seems to reflect a very ancient nature as a species as well as the fact that their DNA patterns
   lie within a specific band that is on a more primitive scale.
</p>
<p>4) The species skin tone variation seems to be widespread,
   with skin colors ranging from bluish gray to beige, tan, brown, or white. There are factors that affect skin color, and one
   of them is the state of general health of the entity. Skin color is known to change after they have consumed nourishment.
</p>
<p>5)
   There are no reproductive organs or reproductive capability with the cloned species. The brain capacity is estimated to be
   between 2500 and 3500 cc, compared to 1300 cc of humans. Due to the cloning process, the neural matter is artificially grown
   brain matter. The Grays have technology that enables them to insert memory patterns and consciousness into clones in any manner
   or pattern that they wish.
</p>
<p>6) They have two separate brains with many more lobes than human brains, and contain a crystalline
   network for telepathic communication and group control. The cloned species function in essentially a hive mind. Their movement
   is deliberate, slow, and precise.
</p>
<p>7) The Grays consume nourishment through a process of absorption through their skin.
   The process, according to abductees who have witnessed it, involves spreading a biological slurry mixture that has been mixed
   with hydrogen peroxide (which oxygenates the slurry and eliminates bacteria) onto their skin. Waist products are then excreted
   back through the skin. Many abductees have noticed that the Grays have a distinct series of odors, many of them appear to
   be similar to a mentholated cinnamon smell.
</p>
<p>8) The Gray clones have one major organ that has the combined function
   of a heart and lung. The rest of their body consists of a homogeneous spongy tissue infused with circulatory systems, glands,
   and other amorphous structures. Each of the Gray clones has an individuality, but it is much less pronounced than in the human,
   where tendencies toward expanded awareness and shared consciousness are minimized through cultural conditioning, programming,
   and basic cranial differences in structure.
</p>
<p>9) The clones are subservient to the taller Grays. The smaller Grays possess
   an electronically monitored and controlled social memory complex that allows them to function effectively in a group-mind
   mode. They do not have distinct individuality, as the larger Grays have. When one of the Grays dies, it's implant serves as
   a focusing device for retrieval of the body. When Grays die, their bodies are "beamed" away.
</p>
<p>2.1.2.3 Human/Gray Interbreeds</p>
<p>1)
   The Grays are cross-breeding with human beings in an attempt to populate the Earth with hybrid beings that serve their agenda
   for global domination. This activity has been going on for a long time and has produced many generations of Crossbreeds. These
   crossbreeds are potentially more superior in function than either humans or Grays.
</p>
<p>2) Many individuals have seen breeding
   labs, both underground and on spacecraft. In those labs, Gray fetuses can be seen. Those fetuses have heads that are "out
   of proportion" to their body as compared to humans.
</p>
<p>3) The Gray clones are abducting human females, both temporarily
   and permanently, and using them for cross-breeding in order to produce a new hybrid species that does not serve humanity.
</p>
<p>4)
   The Grays do understand the concept of bonding, but only intellectually in terms of bonding (between a human mother/ ovum
   source and an alien cross-bred child) that will serve to contribute to the survival of the cross-breed. They recognize the
   need for it in the child only in terms of survival.
</p>
<p>5) Thousands of years ago, many races interbred here to create
   an intelligent and adaptive being. But, the current interbreeding is to create humans that will serve the Visitors. Interbreeding
   enables them to establish a presence and commanding influence here. Interbreeding has been going on for several generations.
   It is becoming very successful.
</p>
<p>6) There are hybrids that are living among us in our world today. There are not many,
   but there will be ever more in the future. These are intelligent humans that do not serve humanity. There are also hybrids
   that actually possess the Visitor's consciousness. Soon, the Visitors will be able to live on the surface of our planet permanently.
</p>
<p>2.1.2.4
   Zeta Reticulans
</p>
<p>1) The Zeta Reticuli Grays have an insect-based genetic system and are about 3.5 to 4.5 feet in height.
   They have no external genitalia. They are less aggressive toward humans than the other Gray species. These beings are from
   Zeta Reticuli in the Reticulum Constellation. These humanoids have very distinctive facial features with a turned-up nose
   and long slender neck.
</p>
<p>2) The Reticulans appear to be a highly aware grouping of entities that function as a social
   memory complex. Individuality appears to exist, but is overshadowed by the group mind. The Reticulans are millions of years
   old as a species and have a weakened DNA structure as the result of conflicts that involved nuclear radiation. The Reticulans
   have relied on artificial reproduction or cloning and face extinction from incurable diseases. They are creating hybrid human-Reticulans
   capable of mating with humans.
</p>
<p>3) The Reticulans are largely involved in scientific exobiological surveys as well as
   systemic geological observation and field studies. Their civilization appears to be totally dedicated to interstellar research
   and life analysis. The Network has been on Earth for the past 50 years.
</p>
<p>4) The basic objectives of the Reticulans is
   to use nullification and domination to control the leaders of various targeted civilizations. They accomplish this by taking
   out the leaders and replacing them with entities they can control.
</p>
<p>5) Military operations of the Reticulan species
   consist of colonization of unprotected civilizations for the purpose of setting up logistical supply depots, slave sources,
   acquisition of potential allies, and biological materials.
</p>
<p>6) The process of conquering a planet involves location
   of beings that vibrate in resonance with their vibrational frequency. These located beings are then told that they are the
   Elite or Chosen Ones who will conquer or lead the human race and rule the world for their Gray masters.
</p>
<p>7) Often the
   located beings are physically taken aboard a craft and given physical examinations, provided with implants, given accelerated
   data through inculcation methods that will help them serve the Grays. The function of the Elite is to decimate portions of
   its own race in an effort to reduce populations to manageable limits so the remainder can be easily controlled.
</p>
<p>2.1.2.5
   Sirians
</p>
<p>1) Sirius apparently possesses qualities that develop some highly unusual personalities. Known as the Dog Star,
   in the constellation Canis Major, it is the brightest star in the firmament, and more than twenty times as luminous as our
   own sun.
</p>
<p>2) The Sirians are a hybrid race with traits that are similar to the Blonds and Reptilian species. They are
   similar in appearance to humans except for the eyes, which have vertical slit pupils, and an elongated nose. They have short
   blond body hair under the tight fitting body suit uniforms that they wear.
</p>
<p>3) The Sirians are actively involved in
   a war with the Grays from the Orion constellation. They have formed an alliance with the tall Blonds against the Grays. They
   are working in underground bases on Earth for the purposes of abducting humans and programming them. They are also performing
   genetic work there with humanoid forms.
</p>
<p>4) Sirian Females have long hair, feminine features, and breasts. One female
   has been seen wearing a blue two-piece uniform with a pendant on her forehead. The males wear tight fitting hoods with round-shaped
   radio receivers and short antenna over their left ears. The insignia over their left breast is triangular in shape with either
   three parallel lines across it or a winged serpent inside of it.
</p>
<p>2.1.2.6 Insectoids</p>
<p>1) Although there appears
   to be a large variety of extraterrestrials in the form of insects, the most common and advanced species appears to be a giant
   insect creature, two meters (6'6") tall that resembles a Praying Mantis. It should be noted that experiencers feel that this
   type is no insect, but rather an intelligent, gentle-spirited, but somewhat "hyper" and jerky-moving, human-like lifeform,
   both males and females.
</p>
<p>2) These Beings have long, narrow faces, with long, narrow, large eyes, sharply slanted upward
   and outward in an almost narrow-V position, given an almost insect-like appearance. This comparison is heightened by the Praying-Mantis
   types' extremely thin, long torsos, long, extremely-thin arms which are usually crooked into a sharp bend at the mid-joint,
   with the hand and fingers/mitten sloping almost vertically downward from the "wrist", and legs also bent at an almost right-angle
   at the mid-joint, creating a crouched pose. The overall effect is the characteristic "Praying Mantis" look. 
</p>
<p>3) Witnesses
   have reported seeing this strange and frightening being on several occasions. In Maryland, in 1973, a group of four Preying
   Mantis aliens abducted a law student and examined him. On another occasion, a creature, fitting the same description, was
   found attacking a teenage boy.
</p>
<p>The boy was rescued with some difficulty and the being was chased away.</p>
<p>2.1.2.7
   Other Smooth Skinned Humanoids
</p>
<p>1) Other species of this type include the Akartians, Iargans, Dwarfs, Hairies (Yeti
   type, Sasquatch), and Ummo's. Another group is from the Arcturus system. These humanoids have red hair and have been called
   Oranges. They remain neutral toward humans and are waiting to reclaim a portion of the Earth for them selves.
</p>
<p>2) Another
   group of entities that have a more pessimistic view of human fitness for being in charge of the planet's resources is a very
   large humanoid race that are described in the book of Genesis as the Nephilim (literally giants) who impregnated human females
   who then gave birth to giants. This race is reported to originate from the constellation of Lyra and inhabits the planet Nibiru.
</p>
<p>3)
   There is an on-world presence of humanoid races that have historically assisted humanity in its evolutionary development.
   Such a race has been the remnants of the ancient Lemurian and Atlantean civilizations that established large crystalline cities
   inside the Earth's crust after abandoning their cities/civilizations established on the Earth's surface. They are a tall Nordic-looking
   race living in a subterranean city under the North Pole. Strictly speaking, this group is not extra-terrestrial in origin
   but simply a sub-terrestrial humanoid race that is genetically linked to humanity.
</p>
<p>4) Another group of extraterrestrials
   are off-world ETs that intervene to assist humanity in dealing with off-world ET races. This category is commonly described
   as 'Nordics' and 'Semites' that come from Altair Alpha Centauri, who are humanoid in appearance, between 7-8 feet in height.
   Altair's fourth and fifth planets are inhabited. In fact, the people from Altair colonized the Pleiades system long ago. The
   human-looking Pleiadean extraterrestrials are actually ancestrally Altairians. There are two variants, the Semitic-looking
   ones and the Nordic-looking ones.
</p>
<p>2.1.3 Scaly Rough Skinned Reptilians</p>
<p>1) Scaly rough skinned humanoids describe
   the appearance of the Reptilian species from the Draco constellation and the Capella System. These beings have elongated heads
   and eyes with vertical slit pupils. Some of the reptilian hierarchy are albino white and not the usual green or brown. Some
   have conical horns midway between the brow and the top of the skull.
</p>
<p>2) For the most part, we are dealing with another
   species that is humanoid in shape, but Reptilian in heritage. Their leader elite are the "Draco" that have special "wings",
   which are flaps of skin, supported by long ribs. These can be folded back against the body. They are also known as the "Dragon
   Race" and their symbology usually includes a Winged Serpent. There are elements of their species that do not have wings -
   the "soldier class" and "scientists" have none.
</p>
<p>3) They are all 'cold blooded' and must have a balanced environment
   to maintain body temperature. The "soldier class" of the species can bury themselves in the ground and wait long periods of
   time in order to ambush their enemy. If need be they can survive on one very large meal every few weeks or even once a year.
   As a species, they are well suited for space travel due to their ability to hibernate. These reptoids have scales that protect
   them from moisture loss. They have no sweat glands.
</p>
<p>4) The scales (scutes) are much larger on their backs, making the
   skin waterproof. The scales elsewhere on the body are more flexible. They have three fingers with an opposing thumb. The eyes
   are catlike and large. They have twin nostrils at the end of a short stubby muzzle. They are mostly meat eaters. The mouth
   is more like a slit, but they do have teeth that are differentiated into incisors, canines, and molars. They average from
   6 to 7 feet in height.
</p>
<p>5) The Reptilian (amphibian) humanoids have been interacting with Earth for ages. Many contactees
   and abductees repeatedly describe an insignia of a Flying Serpent on the shoulder patch, badge, medallion or helmet. The Serpent
   Race lives under the ground.
</p>
<p>6) The Draconian Group is a Confederation with subgroups (The "Serpent Race" from Sirius)
   and various crossbreeds. They set up bases inside of Venus, the Earth, and other locations. Earth is on their ancient space
   trade routes.
</p>
<p>7) The Draco are about 8 feet tall and have winged appendages coming out of their shoulders, dark scaly
   skin, and have glowing red eyes. They have the ability to fly and usually operate at night. These entities, as well as the
   elite of the other Reptilian species (that also have winged appendages) were the source for some of the legends of the past
   relating to Gargoyles and Valkyries. It is also apparent that some of the qualities ascribed to vampires have also been taken
   from these creatures.

<p>8) Some Reptilians eat humans like we eat chicken. In the United States, there are great, underground
   food-storage rooms full of preserved human bodies. Sometimes the bodies are those of children. It is not only children but
   also adults that Reptilians eat. However, children are preferred because they are not poisoned with substances like caffeine,
   nicotine, alcohol and other things that adults are saturated with.
</p>
<p>9) The Reptilians don't seem to be dependent on
   humans as a food source, although part of their experimental work with us is toward the end of future food supply/production.
   When they become involved with crossbreeding (humans and Reptilians), they are not doing it for racial survival but for the
   purpose of creating a subclass (slave race) within their own culture. These half-breeds are to be biological war machines
   and laborers, etc. They are to be someone else's property.
</p>
<p>10) The Reptilians seem to have little regard for us as
   living beings. (They think we are as ugly and repulsive to them as we ever portrayed them to be, and that we, the human race,
   are "as valuable as weeds".) However, they do seem to consider some of us valuable property. One gets the feeling they will
   continue to use us as they see fit, or, if we ever become a real problem as a group, they would sooner wipe us out than deal
   with us.
</p>
<p>11) They do not fear humanity and consider themselves far superior to humans by all comparisons. They supposedly
   consider the surface of this planet to be a poisonous, inhospitable environment and "allow" us to live here, since they live
   below the surface and in space. (We and our surface environment function as a physical buffer or living shield around their
   home underground.)
