        <p>This story features a dialogue with someone claiming to be from 2036, detailing a post-world war society focused on community, family, and sustainability.</p>
        <p>This future world, emerging from a devastating conflict in 2015, prioritizes local food production, environmental recovery, and a decentralized government structure. The time traveler discusses the ethical implications of revealing future events and highlights significant societal shifts, including advanced renewable energy, the critical role of religion and personal relationships, and changes in technology and global politics.</p>
        <p>Through discussions on various topics, from space exploration to social values, the individual paints a speculative vision of a future world shaped by the challenges of rebuilding society after widespread destruction.</p>

        <h2>John's World in 2036</h2>
        <p><em>The following posts are isolated to questions and comments about John's worldline in 2036.</em></p>
        <p><u>What are your memories of 2036?</u></p>
        <p>I remember 2036 very clearly. It is difficult to describe 2036 in detail without spending a great deal of time explaining why things are so different.</p>
        <p>In 2036, I live in central Florida with my family and I'm currently stationed at an Army base in Tampa. A world war in 2015 killed nearly three billion people. The people that survived grew closer together. Life is centered on the family and then the community. I cannot imagine living even a few hundred miles away from my parents.</p>
        <p>There is no large industrial complex creating masses of useless food and recreational items. Food and livestock is grown and sold locally. People spend much more time reading and talking together face to face. Religion is taken seriously and everyone can multiple and divide in the heads.</p>
        <p><u>How is our worldline different from this one?</u></p>
        <p>For starters, the fact that I'm here makes it different. I've also noticed little things like news events that happen at different times, football games won by other teams, things like that.</p>
        <p>I would guess the temporal divergence between this world line and my original is about 1 or 2 percent. Of course, the longer I am here, the larger that divergence becomes from my point of view.</p>
        <p><u>Are you drawn back to your worldline of origin for any reason? Is instability a problem for you?</u></p>
        <p>I'm not sure what you mean by stable. If you mean mentally, there are many things that bother me here but being with my parents right now is important to me. Physically, the only thing really wrong is the number of colds I get.</p>
        <p><u>Are you able to return to your home?</u></p>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <p><u>Do people know where you are? Can you communicate with your home?</u></p>
        <p>No. They do not know where I am and I cannot communicate with them. Interesting idea though. From their point of view, I will return almost exactly at the same moment I left. From their viewpoint, I will only have aged more than expected.</p>
        <p>You do not rewrite history. I can only affect what happens here just as easily as you can. Why do people in this time period worry so much about time traveler's destroying their world line when they have no problem doing it themselves every day?</p>
        <p>My goal is not to be believed. Most people do not take news of the war very well but I find that everyone believes it's inevitable. Even in your own history, are not great inventions and discoveries made during a time of war in your effort to kill and maim in new and more efficient ways?</p>
        <p>No, I do not work for GE or any other company. Are  'stock tips ' really the first thing you want to know about in the future? As a representative of your time period, do you realize what that says about you? You should probably know that this time is not remembered for its selflessness, charity or ability to work together.</p>
        <p><u>Why would I want to talk to you? Why don't you believe you have something interesting or worthwhile to say to someone in the future?</u></p>
        <p>No, the ice caps are not melting any faster than they are now. There is also far less smog and industrial waste in 2036.</p>
        <p>You asked about the North Polar ice pack. I never said the environment wasn't a problem. Doesn't water expand when it freezes? If the polar ice cap melted, wouldn't sea level go down? I don't know if there's enough ice for this to make a difference and I'm not an expert on global warming.</p>
        <p>Yes, I realize people become hostile. I don't expect anyone to believe me and I have nothing to sell. I take no offense by it. Just out of curiosity, if you were a time traveler, what do you think it would take to get people to believe you?</p>
        <p>I suppose we could agree that no particular era in history is famous for its development of humanity but just once I would like to hear questions like,  'What is family life like in the future? How does society deal with poverty? Is AIDS, abortion and drug use still a problem? '</p>
        <p>Why don't I give you a stock tip? The money you make would dilute the intelligence and forethought that a smart person had in picking the stock all by themselves. If I told you how to get rich, I would be taking money from them and giving it to you.</p>
        <p>I am not aware of any physical change to my DNA or  'aura '. I do however seem to be more susceptible to colds.</p>
        <p>Yes, you will remember me if you want to. Worldlines do not change that way and I will only become an insignificant part of your history.</p>
        <p>Yes I believe in Jesus Christ and we pray to God in churches. There are some differences you may be interested in. Religion is a major part of people's life in 2036. Pain and change tend to bring people together and closer to God. However, religion is far more personal than it is now. There are no huge, centralized religions and people talk openly about their beliefs. It might also interest you to know that the day of worship is Saturday, the day God meant to be the Sabbath and the 10 commandments have been restored to the  '10 ' that God gave us.</p>
        <p>Life is much more rural in the future but  'high ' technology is used to communicate and travel. People raise a great deal of their own food and do more  'farm ' work. Yes, compared to now, we do work long hours. After the war, my father made a living selling oranges up and down the West coast of Florida. My closest friend raises horses and another works for a company that maintains  'wireless ' Internet nodes.</p>
        <p>Life has changed so much over my lifetime that it's hard to pin down a  'normal ' day. When I was 13, I was a soldier. As a teenager, I helped my dad haul cargo. I went to college when I was 31 and I was recruited to  'time travel ' shortly after that. Again, I suppose an average day in 2036 is like an average day on the farm.</p>
        <p>Yes, there is a post office. The Internet is still alive and well in the future. People spend more time talking because life is more centered on the community. I've noticed the same type of effect here when the power goes off. People tend to come out of their homes and actually spend time with their neighbors. There is a lot more personal trust and less paranoia.</p>
        <p>When I'm with my parents, I live in a community made up of  'tree houses ' on a large river in Florida. The river floods sometimes and we have access to the Gulf. Most of our neighbors make a living off the sea or in moving cargo by boat.</p>
        <p>No new information there<em> (on UFOs and aliens)</em>. I find that an interesting subject myself. Personally, I think  'UFOs ' might be time travelers with very sophisticated distortion units. But that might be a bit wacky.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest reasons why food production is localized is because the environment is affected with disease and radiation. We are making huge strides in getting it cleaned up. Water is produced on a community level and we do eat meat that we raise ourselves.</p>
        <p>Yes, genetic engineering is used but it's like any other technology. It can be good and bad. One thing we did not do was create more hybrid seeds. What are people thinking?</p>
        <p>I am a Christian Agnostic <em>(Did John mean Gnostic?)</em>. I do not believe faith alone is enough to get us back to God. I'm not sure what happens when we die but I'm pretty sure it's not a walk in the park.</p>
        <p>We are working on it <em>(space travel)</em>.</p>
        <p>My greatest joy is sailing. For fun, I enjoy swimming, playing cards, reading, playing games on the net and talking with people who live in other countries. As a community, we celebrate much more and have bon fires and dances. My hobby is sorting through old magazines and videos of life before the war.</p>
        <p>After the war, early new communities gathered around the current Universities. That's where the libraries were. I went to school at Fort UF, which is now called the University of Florida. Not too much is different except the military is large part of people's life and we spend a great deal of time in the fields and farms at the  'University ' or Fort.</p>
        <p>Most of my memories growing up are not fond. Life was very hard. Simple things make me happy like hugging my mother and father. Yes, we have cameras. More digital. Film is used like painting is today. No hologram camera though.</p>
        <p>Yes we have phones but the service is through the web. Most power generation is localized. It amazes me how much power is wasted now. Yes, solar is big. There is thought that a singularity generator could also be used but most people are against it.</p>
        <p>The elderly are highly revered and looked after on a community level. So are orphans. There is always something people can do now matter what. The idea of avoiding work is looked down on. Everyone pulls together to keep the COMMUNITY strong.</p>
        <p>Hats are more common in the future and flashy colors are less common. Dress is much more functional and we  'dress up ' whenever we get a chance. I have noticed that no one in this time dresses for occasions even when they have the clothes. Why do people wear shorts to church?</p>
        <p>We do not spend nearly the amount of time on our hair as people do now. Women like to wear their hair longer and men have it much shorter. Both sexes shave it all off when they're in active military service.</p>
        <p>Far less medical treatment in the future even though It's more advanced. People die when they now its time to die. No lasers. Genetic medicine and cloning organs are the obvious new techs in the future.</p>
        <p>The Constitution was changed after the war. We have 5 presidents that are voted in and out on different term periods. The vice president is the president of the senate and they are voted separately.</p>
        <p>We have cars, just not a whole bunch of them. There is public transportation from city to city.</p>
        <p>If I could bring some material thing back to your time from 2036, it would be a copy of the new US Constitution.</p>
        <p><u>Can you explain what the purpose of time travel is on your worldline?</u></p>
        <p>In 2036, a great deal of effort is going into  'repairing ' our environment. I was sent to 1975 to get a computer system and take it back to 2036. Time travel is not a secret in 2036 and I expect it will become more common.</p>
        <p><u>Why is time travel used?</u></p>
        <p>Right now, its used to get information or  'items ' that would be helpful in getting a post WWIII world back to a normal condition. There are 7 other time travelers in my unit.</p>
        <p><u>Where do time travelers go the most?</u></p>
        <p>Right now, most of our practical missions are from 1960 to 1980. There is a great deal of research into later and future periods but the farther you go, the lower the divergence confidence of the world line.</p>
        <p><u>Has cancer or AIDS been cured yet?</u></p>
        <p>Aids, no. Cancer, some progress.</p>
        <p><u>What would you say to any world leaders who might be reading this right now?</u></p>
        <p>Revel in your confidence today because you will not win tomorrow.</p>
        <p><u>Earlier you spoke about the patch you wear on your uniform. You said the spirals represented two paths. One was safe and the other lead to God. What does that mean?</u></p>
        <p>The safe way is the one calculated to take you in time where you want to go, the other path will take you to God (death). Both are equally accepted and anticipated before each trip.</p>
        <p><u>What is music like in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>Most of the same music you enjoy is available on archive. However the days of mega-stars playing multiple track studio produced music and lip-synching on a huge stage are pretty much isolated to your time period. Like everything else, music is much less centralized. The general trend is away from  'computer generated ' music and more toward real people playing real instruments. Music is much more of a personal experience. More people know how to read music and play together in small groups.</p>
        <p><u>What are the social prejudices in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>Yes there are. However, as odd as it may sound, it serves a useful purpose in my time. First, you must realize that your experiences with  'prejudice ' and mine are different. I would characterize the intolerance you have here as a result of ignorance and fear. I have observed that people with unfounded and irrational fears about their fellow man in this time have the luxury of not having their beliefs tested.</p>
        <p>After the war, much of the prejudice you have now was swept away by simple necessity. People had to work and fight together just to survive. This has a way of opening a person's eyes as to the value of fellow human beings.</p>
        <p>What difference does the color of a man's skin make when you are both fighting against the same enemy to survive or find water or grow food? On my world line, if a man doesn't't pull his weight in the community, then we feel prejudice towards him as a burden to us. This feeling of shame he experiences then makes him realize his responsibilities.</p>
        <p><u>What is the health care like in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>You would probably not like it at all. I would compare it to what you see in Western movies. We do have hospitals but there are more family doctors and house calls as compared to what you are used to. There is no real organized health care. If you get a serious disease, you die. This however has had a tendency to strengthen the general genetic pool. Doctors are more concerned about things like broken legs, snakebites and delivering healthy babies.</p>
        <p><u>What is the entertainment industry like in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>Again, entertainment is less centralized. There are  'movies ' and  'TV ' but everything is distributed over the net and more people produce their own  'shows '.</p>
        <p><u>What's it like to start from nothing and work your way up in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>Very easy. If you can work with your hands and get along with other people, you will always find work.</p>
        <p><u>Could you travel in time to escape your original worldline? Would you be looked down on for that?</u></p>
        <p>From a physical standpoint, I suppose that would work if you were trying to escape a natural disaster. But you must consider that trying to  'escape ' by time traveling has its own problems. I'm not exactly sure what you mean by being looked down on.</p>
        <p><u>Is there some sort of new world government in place by 2011?</u></p>
        <p>On my world line in 2011, the United States is in the middle of a civil war that has dramatic effects on most of the other Western governments.</p>
        <p><u>When you first started posting online, did anyone believe you?</u></p>
        <p>I don't know if anyone believes me now. But you must realize that I don't expect anyone to believe me or does it affect me one way or the other. I enjoy these conversations too. What would you expect a time traveler to say or do in your time?</p>
        <p><u>How far have computers and software progressed in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>Good question! I would say the biggest difference is in the reliability of the hardware and software. It absolutely amazes me how willing people are here to accept computer and software failures on such a regular basis. I was very surprised to see how prolific it is. You can look forward to very stringent manufacturing parameters and programming discipline. Think back to the early days of the computer and how much work and cleverness it took to fit those programs into such small areas of memory. Has more and cheaper memory brought better programs or just more programs?</p>
        <p>As far as technical specifics, I'm afraid I cannot go into too much detail. However, I will tell you that processor speed and memory size take dramatic leaps forward.</p>
        <p><u>Who won the Super Bowl in 2001?</u></p>
        <p>I do not answer questions like this. Although I don't really know the motivation for the question.I can guess. If a time traveler had knowledge of your future, and you could only ask one question, would this be it? Besides, can you tell me if it rained in New York on June 4th 1932? You are from their future so should you know that?</p>
        <p><u>What type of money do you use in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>Its not very different than it is now. Yes, we have money and credit cards. However, like everything else, the monetary system is decentralized. Banking is based mostly around the community structure. There are no multinational banking or computerized economic systems. There are also no income taxes.</p>
        <p><u>Are radio location systems still used on livestock?</u></p>
        <p>Some of the larger farm communities use electronic markers and fences. I am not a farmer so I don't have very many details about that.</p>
        <p><u>Is the GPS system still in use in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>Oh yes! In fact, the unit I have with me works here. I'm not sure why that surprises me. There are also a great many communications and Internet satellite systems.</p>
        <p><u>Do you still have an American flag? What does it look like in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>Yes, we still have the flag. There is a debate about changing it from 50 stars to 5.</p>
        <p><u>Do any of the states have new names?</u></p>
        <p>Not that I can think of... No major cities anyway. I am aware that some smaller towns changed their names after the war and most universities have the word  'fort ' before them on my world line.</p>
        <p><u>Is it still safe to fish in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>Yes, we can fish. There are some areas that are still too dangerous to spend a lot of time in so we can't fish in those areas.</p>
        <p><u>Is there public transportation in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>A high-speed train system connects the larger cities. Roads are still used for cars and many people ride horses and bikes.</p>
        <p><u>What music and books do you enjoy? Do you play an instrument?</u></p>
        <p>I read a great deal of history. I like piano classics and some older rock and roll. (why did that type of music go so far down hill?) No, I don't play any instruments myself.</p>
        <p><u>Are you taking pictures and video?</u></p>
        <p>Oh yes.</p>
        <p><u>What is your favorite food?</u></p>
        <p>It's very hard for me to find food here. It all scares the Hell out of me. I've found a couple of local farms where I am reasonably sure the raw food is safe and my mother started a garden for me.</p>
        <p><u>Do medical advances in 2036 have anything to do with genetics?</u></p>
        <p>Again, I'm no expert. I believe there is a great deal of progress in treating the cancer cells with modified viruses. So I guess the answer is yes.</p>
        <p>The question involved details on natural disasters and temperatures in 2036.</p>
        <p>That's one area I've decided not to talk about, sorry. The average temperature worldwide is a bit cooler.</p>
        <p><u>Is time travel discussed on the web in 2036? Do you recognize any web sites now from the future?</u></p>
        <p>Time travel is a major point of social discussion. I'll have to check when I get back. Most of the larger servers that were in the major cities were lost or destroyed. I'll try to bring a copy back with me. Perhaps you can check that in your 2036.</p>
        <p><u>Does anything happen in the year 2012? I've heard stories about the world ending.</u></p>
        <p>In my 2012, I was 14 years old spending most of my time living, running and hiding in the woods and rivers of central Florida. The civil war was in its 7th year and the world war was three years away. Yes, there are unusual events in 2012 but they do not cause the world to end. Unfortunately, I have decided not to discuss events that you or I can do anything about. It is important that they be a surprise. Perhaps you are familiar with the story of the Red Sea and the Egyptians?</p>
        <p>The question lists a number of paranormal conspiracy theories and then asks about weather control in the year 2036.</p>
        <p>I must admit I am unfamiliar with most of what you have asked here. I am aware of the Harp system but I don't know how they would control weather with it.</p>
        <p><u>Please describe any details you can about the education system in 2036.</u></p>
        <p>The education system has been through many changes. School in 2036 is no longer a political indoctrination system and students  'learn how to learn '. Since community activity varies from place to place, the emphasis on basic reading, math and language is augmented with skills particular to the community. One school may emphasis farming while another teaches woodworking. Having children is a bit different and less common in 2036. A typical school day involves a setting very much like it was 100 years ago with smaller classes and few administrators to teachers. Other areas of study that are less common now are history, citizenship and personal economics.</p>
        <p><u>If you could post a picture of money used in the future, that would be more impressive than your time machine pictures.</u></p>
        <p>I am disappointed that you feel I am trying to impress you. Why would I bring money from 2036 with me? Besides, isn't that something that could easily be faked? Now if I told you I was your cousin's brother and I knew about that scare on your left leg.that would convince you.</p>
        <p><u>Where do you think all the water came from in the great flood stories?</u></p>
        <p>I believe the explanation for the  'great flood ' stories originate with the changes that occurred near the Mediterranean at the end of the last ice age. Even on this worldline, there is a great deal of evidence to support the fact that sea levels did change radically in isolated areas worldwide.</p>
        <p>I also heard someplace that if the ice mass on Antarctica melted today, sea level worldwide would rise about 100 feet. I'm not exactly sure that's true but still. Mt. Everest might be a bit of a stretch.</p>
        <p>I do however agree with you that there are no physical paradoxes but for the opposite reasoning.</p>
        <p>In 2036, community life is a bit different. People are valued and judged based on their contribution and worth. Work is organized around the family and the value of that work is assessed inside of the community. Most communities range in size from 1000 to 4000 people. If a family wanted to move from one community to another or if a son or daughter wanted to move to another community, they must apply and be interviewed by the community leadership council. During this process, the family or individual is evaluated as to whether or not the work or skill they have is required or necessary to that individual community. Once accepted, the family or individual is expected to uphold their end of the work and support the community. If they don't, the community stops supporting them and they are forced to change their attitude or move away from the community.</p>
        <p>The family work we did was picking, sorting and shipping oranges by sailboat up and down the coast of Florida. We were expected to produce a certain amount for the community and a certain amount for other communities as agreed to by our CLC. In exchange, we received power, water, a certain amount of food and other necessities that were produced inside our community.</p>
        <p>I see this message board as a small community and I have no other way to value the contributions of others on it other than what my past experiences tell me. I have tried to answer as many questions as I can without being annoying, repetitive or inappropriate, and for some of you, entertaining. Under these conditions, I have decided to seek guidance from all of you, the other members of this community, as to whether or not my postings are of any value to the direction of these discussions. If they are getting distracting or repetitive, I will stop and continue to enjoy reading your thoughts and ideas.</p>
        <p><u>Who receives the Nobel Prize for time travel? Since you claim no two worldlines are the same, this information could not hurt anything.</u></p>
        <p>There are a great many people involved with the discovery of time travel. Just as I will not give  'stock tips ', I will not divulge their names as that may impact their lives now.</p>
        <p><u>What would happen if you gave us technical information that's discovered in a year or so?</u></p>
        <p>If I had any and I published them, I'm sure they may have a large impact. Unfortunately, I don't have any with me. Even if I did, I'm sure they would be scrutinized. Again we get back to the same question. If you were a time traveler, what would you do to establish your credibility?</p>
        <p><u>What happens to (name of person asking question)? Am I involved in Time Travel? What of the (armed) resistance?</u></p>
        <p>I have no idea what happens to you in your future. There was a resistance on my worldline but their goal was to maintain power and control over other people. We killed most of them by 2020.</p>
        <p><u>Are there still books in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>Yes, books are still published.</p>
        <p><u>What do they look for when choosing someone for a mission?</u></p>
        <p>Depending on the mission, time travelers are usually chosen for a particular mission based on their ability to gain the cooperation of someone related to the goal on the target worldline. In my case, my grandfather was directly involved with the building and programming of the 5100.</p>
        <p><u>If a time traveler is bad and commits murder or goes crazy, is there anyway they can be recalled?</u></p>
        <p>There is a difference of philosophy between us that should be clarified. Since I believe that all possible outcomes and events are possible, probable and certain, it is impossible to assign  'goodness ' or  'badness ' to a person or situation.</p>
        <p>On some other worldline, I am an insane time traveler causing destruction and death while (name of forum member who confronts John on a regular basis) chases me with his band of devoted followers. However, on this one, I am not. Since both events are certain, their value is neutral.</p>
        <p>You can only assign goodness and badness to the events and experiences you have direct control over or witness. Only actions are good and bad, not people or things. I suppose if I was a psychotic killer, I could accomplish my mission, avoid capture and still return to my worldline of origin without penalty. There would be no way for them to know what happened. However, I believe that action is wrong and I would be accountable to my God.</p>
        <p><u>How do you know our worldline and yours will follow the same path?</u></p>
        <p>This worldline and my own are almost exactly alike.</p>
        <p><u>Why don't you give us more detailed information about the future so we won't be so skeptical?</u></p>
        <p>I think skepticism is a good thing and no one should lose it.</p>
        <p><u>You could still give us details about the future that wouldn't harm anyone and still add to your credibility.</u></p>
        <p>Again, I do not seek to add to my credibility. There is no point to it. Actually, by providing information that was useful, I would be adding to your collective fear that I am real. In that case, this cycle we are in concerning  'truth ' only spirals and gets worse.</p>
        <p><u>Why can't you name the five presidents you have in your time?</u></p>
        <p>Over the past few postings, I have tried to describe the limits of what I will talk about and why. Here is a short recap list. In future postings, I will place the following number next to each question as to why I will not discuss it.</p>
        <p>1. I will not disclose any information that will cause someone to personally gain by its knowledge. This means no stock or sports tips.</p>
        <p>2. I will not disclose any detailed information that would allow someone to avoid death by probability. This means no earthquake or bombing information.</p>
        <p>3. I will not disclose any information that may compromise any future actions by individual people or threaten their family and well-being.</p>
        <p>On my worldline, we are no longer afraid of the  'NWO '. Are you afraid of Nazis?</p>
        <p>The reason the job of President was split into an office of 5 has 4 main reasons. With 5 (presidents), foreign policy is more consistent, power shifting between parties has less of an impact on the overall government, individual strengths between presidents add to the strength of the overall office, and one president is elected for each major area in the United States.</p>
        <p><u>What is the extent of Presidential power in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>The office of President is far more diluted and decentralized than it is here. The powers of the national government are more defined and reside more at the county and state level.</p>
        <p><u>What is the new government like in 2036 compared to the current one?</u></p>
        <p>I think the new government is good. However, since the concept of nationally subsidized welfare is gone, most people here may not appreciate it.</p>
        <p><u>Where is the new US capitol?</u></p>
        <p>The new US capitol is in Omaha Nebraska.</p>
        <p><u>How do the 5 presidents take power?</u></p>
        <p>The voting for individual candidates is on a rotating schedule.</p>
        <p><u>What are the other time travelers' destinations, and missions?</u></p>
        <p>I am not aware of the details of other missions. Of the seven, three had already left before I did. I suspect they are on similar missions.</p>
        <p><u>Is it possible to send a message through time?</u></p>
        <p>Unless the information physically travels with the person; none that I'm aware of.</p>
        <p><u>If you're from the future, than you should know what happens to (personal names of people on forum)? Am I involved in time travel?</u></p>
        <p>This is the only question I found from your postings that you could be referring to. Again, I have no knowledge of you in any possible future nor would I comment on it if I did. As far as the photograph of me in a uniform, I'm not sure what that would prove even if I had one.</p>
        <p><u>Your future seems to be fixated on killing people. Isn't there a criminal justice system or do you just enjoy killing people?</u></p>
        <p>Perhaps you could take the dialogue in question and post it with your question. However, if I understand you, you're asking about death on my worldline. Yes, it is more a part of our lives than it is yours (at least for now) and capitol punishment is a reality. </p>
        <p>Although the documents posted were printed from a computer printer, is it really that hard to believe that manual typing is just a bit more common in thirty years? After the war, many things like manual printing machines, bicycles, sailboats and hand tools were valued a great deal. I have noticed more people in California are installing wood burning stoves. Are the Olympics still being played in the future?</p>
        <p>As a result of the many conflicts, no, there were no official Olympics after 2004. However, it appears they may be revived in 2040.</p>
        <p><u>What sort of future do you imagine after 2036? Will we colonize the solar system?</u></p>
        <p>Keep in mind that not all humans were destroyed but we were all affected. There is an effort going into colonizing space because it is believed that the problems of overpopulation were a large cause of the war. Personally, my generation sees itself as having a duty to try and repair the mess our fathers handed to us. When we were young, most of us had a small taste of the world you live in now and our only dream is to clean it up and give it back to those still able to have children. </p>
        <p>(1) Industrialized mass production does not produce the uncountable tonnage of useless consumer items so gleefully absorbed by your society. I would estimate there are about 10 units like mine (C204) and twenty larger units (C206). The main difference is the sensitivity and number of the main Cesium clocks. I would estimate that some sort of public time travel will be common around 2045. </p>
        <p>(2) I'm not aware of any other time traveler's  'here ' now. But if they are here, I'm sure they're pouring over sports history books so they can go back in time another week and start a friendly conversation on the web. </p>
        <p>(3) The  'Mad Cow ' story here is yet to begin but don't worry, the fruited gelatin deserts are safe. </p>
        <p>(4) I'm glad to see it's so easy for to dismiss the Middle East. Yes, I suppose it is a no brainer but pretty soon it will be a  'no arrmer ' and a  'no legger '. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, winners of historical sports betting events are not high on the priority list of people in 2036. As a thought experiment, if I did tell you who the winning horse was and you killed it before the final race, would that make me a liar or would it support my statement that our worldlines are about 2% different? Do you know who won that race 30 years ago? If you could change one thing about your government right now, what would it be? </p>
        <p>The United States is still a representative republic in 2036 but it was touch and go for a while. After the war, the U.S. had divided into 5 general areas based on their economic and defensive strengths. Many people blamed the government organization for the war and the last Constitutional Congress was held in 2020 to officially scrap the Constitution and start over. Fortunately, this exercise in anger pointed out how hard it was to come up with anything better. It was decided the document wasn't at fault. As a result, there have been a few small changes to the Constitution and the executive branch but you would easily recognize it. The average citizen is more educated about the Constitution and aware of the rights and responsibilities it gives them. Federal power has been decentralized and the focus of daily politics is in the state senates. Federal law has also been streamlined but much harder to change or make additions to. </p>
        <p>The people who sign my paycheck told me why we needed a 5100 and sent me off to get one. I was not in a position to make alternate suggestions. As I recall, isn't the Cray a rather large system? We need something portable. The 5100 isn't required for its reliability, its needed to translate between APL, UNIX and a few obscure IBM mainframe languages. The fishing is great and you're more than welcome to join us but the  'me ' here is only three. I'll have to tell him your coming. </p>
        <p><u>Can you give us some personal stories of your past?</u> </p>
        <p>I was born in 1998 so I do share some childhood memories with all of you. I remember going to Disney World at Christmas and I remember going to the beach in Daytona. When the civil  'conflict ' started and got worse, people generally decided to either stay in the cities and lose most of their civil rights under the guise of security or leave the cities for more isolated and rural areas. Our home was searched once and the neighbor across the street was arrested for some unknown reason. That convinced my father to leave the city. </p>
        <p>From the age of 8 to 12, we lived away from the cities and spent most of our time in a farm community with other families avoiding conflict with the federal police and National Guard. By that time, it was pretty clear that we were not going back to what we had and the division between the  'cities ' and the  'country ' was well defined. My father made a living by putting together 12-volt electrical systems and sailing  'commodities ' up and down the coast of Florida. I spent most of my time helping him. </p>
        <p>Outright open fighting was common by then and I joined a shotgun infantry unit in 2011. I served with the  'Fighting Diamondbacks ' for about 4 years. (Hearing in my right ear isn't as good as I would like it). The civil war ended in 2015 when Russia attacked the U.S. cities (our enemy), China and Europe. As unusual and bad as my childhood might seem, I wouldn't trade it for anything. </p>
        <p>Africa is not a pleasant place to be in 2036 although I would characterize it as recovering. </p>
        <p>The music you enjoy now is quite popular and available it's just not produced in anywhere near the same amount. There is a revival of  'local ' and classical music. Many people have learned to play their own. I personally enjoy Big Band, some Classical and interesting lyrical pieces from the 1970s and 1980s. </p>
        <p>Yes, we still have football and you will easily recognize it in 2036. </p>
        <p>Yes, there are significant advances in computer science. It's interesting how easy it is to be fixated on the  'machine ' itself without any curiosity about many of the support systems. This is not really big news but if / then is out and if /then /maybe is in. </p>
        <p>Yes I am with the  'me ' on this worldline and he is three now. I find that fact to be rather hard for people to get along with so I don't bring it up directly. This is the second time I have  'met myself '. </p>
        <p>The  'machine ' is owned by the military. I am part of a unit stationed in Tampa Florida. The real energy is in creating the machine, not operating it. It's interesting you should bring up the divergence percentage. You may find it entertainingly interesting to know that the divergence can be more accurate with more sensitive gravity sensors and clocks. The C206 uses 6 Cesium clocks and an active method of timing the changes in the atom. We time travel to solve problems. A great deal of effort is going into repairing the environment and infrastructure. </p>
        <p><u>(1) Who wins the (sporting event) for the next 20 years?</u> </p>
        <p>I don't know. Even if I did, you could stop the horse(s)anyway and make it untrue. </p>
        <p><u>(2) Who will be elected president for the next 20 years?</u> </p>
        <p>Please see number 2. </p>
        <p><u>(3) Will there still be (popular motorcycle) around when you are born?</u> </p>
        <p>I was born in 1998. </p>
        <p><u>(4) Please tell me the price of gold for the last 20 years.</u> </p>
        <p>I don't understand the importance of this type of information. Please tell me your opinion why this is interesting and worth remembering for 30 years. </p>
        <p><u>(5) Will it still be lawful for me to own handguns?</u> </p>
        <p>I thought owning a handgun was legal in the United States? Yes, being familiar with firearms (along with the other responsibilities of the Constitution) becomes an important part of people's lives in thirty years. Korea United? </p>
        <p>I guess you could say that. Taiwan, Japan and Korea were all  'forcefully annexed ' before N Day. </p>
        <p>I don't remember a great deal about media coverage during the civil conflicts. I would probably characterize it the same way you see coverage of Waco, Ruby Ridge and Elian Gonzalez. </p>
        <p>From my viewpoint, yes, this is an alternate timeline. From your viewpoint, no. </p>
        <p>Australia is sort of interesting in what is unknown. After the war, they were not very cooperative or friendly (can't blame them really). It is known they did repulse a Chinese invasion and most of their cities were hit. They have a trading relationship with the U.S. but I would characterize them as reclusive and ticked off. </p>
        <p>After reading the questions, I want to paint a picture that may help with the general theme of our collective experience in 2036. The war had very profound affects on people and how they relate to each other. As individuals, almost everyone in 2036 is very familiar with death. We all have stories of loved ones that have died from disease, war or acts of inhumanity. Most of us have even taken part in dishing the same thing out to the other side. As a result, we have become far more compassionate to the ones we love but mush less forgiving to those who don't pull their weight. We are more accepting of other's differences in our community because we depend on them to survive. We are also more conservative with our resources and closer to God because for a period, life on Earth was Hell. </p>
        <p>The other major difference is in the concept of good and evil. With multiple worlds come multiple decisions and outcomes. For every good act, there is an equal and possible bad act on another worldline. Taken to the extreme, this must mean that in God's eyes, there is no total good and total bad in the superverse. It balances itself out to infinity. I believe we are judged on the decisions we make as individuals and the good/evil I see on my worldline is an illusion that has no worth to God. My reaction to it is what's important to God. Although this may seem rather heartless, it does allow me to see past the evil that people do and acknowledge the core of potential goodness inside them. </p>
        <p>5. We do not live in a racist society but definitely a prejudice one. Everyone carries their own water. </p>
        <p>6. Our government looks very much like yours. It is a representative republic. </p>
        <p>7. My definition of a patriot is anyone who defends the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. </p>
        <p>8. Religion has become far less centralized. Extremes tend to bring you closer to God so I would characterize religion and spirituality as a much more of a personal institution. </p>
        <p>10. It's difficult to define the most predominant religion. Christianity has fragmented into many groups and people with different beliefs speak mush more openly with others who have different outlooks and opinions. I would imagine there are large groups of Hindus, Buddhists and Muslims but I have not come across them personally. </p>
        <p>11. No, Jesus did not come back. At least not that I'm aware of. If or when Jesus returns, do you think he'll be a lamb or a lion? </p>
        <p>12. No mission to Mars but we are working on it. There is a group working on the idea of gravity displacement to get into space but the calculations and error rate are very large obstacles to overcome. </p>
        <p>13. We don't know what's on Mars yet. </p>
        <p>14. We're not on the moon yet either. A great deal of technical effort is going into cleaning the planet up. </p>
        <p>15. I'm not aware of any  'mind control ' devices being used on you now. However, there are a great many  'non lethal ' weapon systems in development that turn out to be quite lethal. Sometimes I watch your television programs that show SWAT teams using new non-lethal weapons. They usually start out with,  'In the future, the army and police will fight its enemies with new weapons systems. ' When they use the word  'enemy ', they're talking about YOU! </p>
        <p>You don't really think the Marines are going to jump out of helicopters overseas with sticky goop, pepper spray and seizure lights, do you? </p>
        <p>16. I'm not familiar with the term Psionics. I'll look it up and see if we just have another word for it. </p>
        <p>17. Yes, Europe is a mess. </p>
        <p>18. Yes, I think the New World Order idea tried to establish itself. I would consider them the combination of the old U.S. federal system, Europe, Canada and Australia. </p>
        <p>19. When you say  'teleportation ', I assume you mean public transportation. Yes, we have a basic high-speed system. </p>
        <p>20. I don't know if the government created AIDS. I tend to think yes but controlling it escaped them as it mutated. You can't have conspiracy to limit the population with a disease without the cure. </p>
        <p>21. Yes, homosexuals are in the army. You tend to look past the individual differences of people when their job is to protect your life. </p>
        <p>22. Yes, there are  'gay ' people in 2036. </p>
        <p>23. I am a white male. </p>
        <p>24. Yes, there is an entertainment industry. Again, it is very decentralized. The technology to express yourself with video is so readily available that many people do it all by themselves or in small groups. Much of the distribution is over the web. I would compare it theater here. </p>
        <p>25. I don't know what you mean by VR? </p>
        <p>26. The average lifespan is about 60 but I expect that will improve as we get things cleaned up. </p>
        <p>27. Yes, paper money is still widely used. </p>
        <p>28. The 21st century has awhile to go but the most significant person in my opinion is the farmer-general who led us to victory. </p>
        <p>29. Even for you, Tesla technology can be found in appliances, motors and generators. I would have to say we have come a long way on Tesla's foundation but we don't have electricity rays that cause earthquakes. </p>
        <p>31. Yes, we have the death penalty. We also have public punishment. </p>
        <p>32. The most common crime is theft. </p>
        <p>33. I don't understand what you mean by  'race mixing '. </p>
        <p>34. Cloning is not common. However, altering the sperm and egg cell are common. It is very difficult to have children in 2036 for environmental reasons. </p>
        <p>35. It's hard to say what the exact racial make up of the U.S. is. I would say it's probably the same minus 130 million people or so. </p>
        <p>36. No, there is no segregation. </p>
        <p>37. The education system is very similar to yours but the organization and implementation is controlled on a community and county level. Various communities also specialize in certain disciplines. </p>
        <p>38-39. My comments on equal rights and  'women's roles ' could be quite lengthy and controversial. I wish to discuss that separately. However, women do fight in the military just as the men do but their role on the community level is very conservative. </p>
        <p>40. Having children is such a serious issue in 2036 that birth control is almost unheard of. It is very difficult and precious to have and raise children. Again, this is an issue I will be happy to go into later. </p>
        <p>41. Yes, there are same sex marriages but it's not very common. Again, people have lived through so much hardship that if what someone else is doing does not affect them or harm the community, it's not a big issue. </p>
        <p>42. South America went relatively unharmed. However, there is still a great deal of internal conflict with conventional arms. </p>
        <p>43. Yes, people use drugs that alter consciousness but they are not very common. </p>
        <p>44. Yes, I know who the Beatles are. Old music and other entertainment is available on the web. </p>
        <p>45. There is another Pope but I do not know his name. </p>
        <p>Yes, EMP took out a great number of electronic devices. That's one of the reasons why we don't have reliable technology laying around. However, in the opening hours of N Day, the Russians did not launch any high altitude detonations. They knew we would most likely clean up after them so they wanted everyone outside the cities to be able to communicate. Most of the warheads that hit the cities came in threes and exploded close to the ground. The heavy EMP damage was isolated to those areas. Actually, you will probably be quite impressed with our Internet. It's based on a series of independent, self-powered nodes that are mobile and can be put up anywhere. It looks a great deal like your current cell phone system. </p>
        <p>Yes, there are a great many people who think that Revelations has come to pass. However, the new fear is that Christ has returned, he's not telling us and he's very angry. I am not familiar with the Fatima Prophesies but I am aware of the term. I was not sent here to change anything. Since it would not affect my home anyway, it would be rather pointless. </p>
        <p>Yes, handmade items and the skills to make them are quite prevalent and people take a great deal of pride in their work. People with the skills to make clothing, work with leather and wood or cultivate a garden have become quite valuable. Please do not think your questions are unimportant. I enjoy the conversation. </p>
        <p>Fiji? I've noticed that when most Americans think about Canada in this time, they think about pine trees, chooks and back-bacon. It may interest you to know that most Canadians in 2036 are some of the most efficient, ruthless and dangerous people I know. God help Quebec. </p>
        <p>You couldn't even answer one simple question about music? </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, your question is rather difficult for me. Any personal experience I might have with your worldline at a specific moment is limited to my viewpoint and age. I can't tell you what music is popular in the next few years because the  'me ' here is only three years old. In addition, how does someone decide what the most popular music trend is? It would seem rather subjective to me. Thinking about it now I sort of wonder what it would be like to be a teenager now and know the answer to that question. When I was thirteen I used to worry about which shotgun slug would take a door handle off and whether or not I had any dry socks. Current fallout estimates are accurate but a bit exaggerated. </p>
        <p>Your example of what people would do based on something I might say is accurate. However, my concern would be the potential actions of a single person, not the masses. In 1963, if I suggested that someone should watch the book depository windows as the President went by, the actions of a single person might have a huge impact on history. You also asked if I've visited my  'past ' family. That's where I am now. </p>
        <p>John mentions that he has no idea what GINGER is but he mentions media hype and alludes to IT not amounting to much. </p>
        <p>Again, I don't believe I said that either. My point in that conversation was about feeling manipulated by hype. Since they ARE asking you to buy something, I would be very interested in your lengthy and critical postings about ITS credibility. If you could post that link I would very much like to see it. </p>
        <p>John says the mechanical typewriter is a major machine again in the future and the Internet still exists and is widely used. </p>
        <p>Actually, what I said was,  '.you may be surprised at how many people use typewriters. ' I don't understand the conflict. What's wrong with typewriters? At least you don't have to plug them in. </p>
        <p><u>What is the speed of the average computer in the future?</u> </p>
        <p>GHz is not a useful measurement. Computers are no longer measured by their speed as mush as the number of variables (not calculations) they can handle per second. </p>
        <p><u>Who is the major super power in 2036?</u> </p>
        <p>It depends on how you define power. If you mean military, the world has developed into an odd balance. There are plenty of nuclear weapons left but if anyone uses them they, will be instantly erased from the planet by everyone else, regardless of the politics. We are very tired of war. </p>
        <p><u>Are the two political parties still Republicans and Democrats?</u> </p>
        <p>There are no Republicans or Democrats to speak of. There are now over 10 major political parties. </p>
        <p><u>How many States are there?</u> </p>
        <p>The states, as you know them, still exist but their political power has been combined with other states around them. There are now 5 major geopolitical areas in the United States. </p>
        <p><u>Which states are the worst to live in?</u> </p>
        <p>When you can't drink the water its bad everywhere. </p>
        <p><u>Do companies like (popular software and Internet names) still exist?</u> </p>
        <p>No. </p>
        <p><u>Does money look different than it does now?</u> </p>
        <p>No, money is pretty much the same. Unfortunately, I do not have any money with me because I wouldn't be able to use it here. </p>
        <p><u>Does the government know there that time travel going on?</u> </p>
        <p>In 2036, yes. </p>
        <p><u>How many time travelers are there on your team? How do they choose new ones?</u> </p>
        <p>My unit has between 6 and 10. When I left, there were 7 others. Military service, physical fitness, history or technical background and special relationship to target contacts get you in the door. Why can't you answer questions about natural disasters? No one can change something now that would cause an earthquake or stop one. I will not share information that would allow someone to avoid death by probability. </p>
        <p>PERSONAL RULES FOR TEMPORAL DISCLOSURE: </p>
        <p>(1). I will not disclose any information that will cause someone to personally gain by its knowledge. </p>
        <p>(2). I will not disclose any detailed information that would allow someone to avoid death by probability. </p>
        <p>(3). I will not disclose any information that may compromise any future actions by individual people or threaten their family and well being. </p>
        <p><u>What kind of music is popular, what kind of recreation is enjoyable, what holidays are important?</u> </p>
        <p>I'm not sure if you wanted to discuss these or not. If yes, I will be happy to do that. </p>
        <p><u>Do you feel some pleasure in breathing clean air and not having to check a radiation counter every few miles?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes I do. However there is a fear about being here that I can only define as uncertainty. When I walk around in 2001, the air smells clean but I wonder if it really is. In 2036, there is no gray. The air is either clean or it will kill you. That feeling is very overwhelming when I eat here. </p>
        <p><u>Name any near future event that makes history.</u> </p>
        <p>You mean other than the mad cow pandemic, the breakthroughs in high-energy physics and the unknown functions of the 5100? I realize I've only been on this board for a few weeks but I assume you've read the other postings I've made about these issues months ago in order to be so definitive. </p>
        <p><u>Is propane still around in the future?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes but not very much of it comes from natural gas. Hydrogen is converted into propane because it's easier to handle. </p>
        <p><u>I would hope the location I live in would be spared (the Hawaiian Islands).</u> </p>
        <p>My parents went to Hawaii on their Honeymoon. My dad told me a quick story about going to a fast food store and paying 6 or 7 dollars for a hamburger. I got an image in my head of a huge tanker filled with frozen hamburgers headed into the Pacific. Hawaii is very dependant on the mainland for food, isn't it? </p>
        <p>Thank you for your kind words. </p>
        <p><u>Does the last name (forum personal name) have any historical relevance?</u> </p>
        <p>You may leave a message to yourself if you wish. </p>
        <p><u>What happens with Australia?</u> </p>
        <p>I believed I wrote about Australia a bit earlier. </p>
        <p><u>What colloquial language is used in the future?</u> </p>
        <p>Many people use the Internet for communication and entertainment. I would say that affects our speech. We type very fast. </p>
        <p><u>What exactly happens to the water?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, radiation affected the water but that can always be distilled out. There are biological hazards that cannot. In addition, fresh water is hard to come by without talking to someone with a gun first. </p>
        <p><u>Does intercontinental transportation still exist? Have you visited other countries?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, but the market is much smaller. No, I have not been overseas. </p>
        <p><u>You have said you will not participate in helping anyone avoid 'death by probability'. Yet many things you have said could have caused an individual to do or not do something that will now result dying, or escaping death.</u> </p>
        <p>It would help if you could give an example. If you are referring to the conflict and war in your future, I'm not sure I'm specific enough to help any individuals avoid anything. Suggesting there is a war coming is a bit different than saying avoid Washington DC at 3:45 AM on March 12, 2015. </p>
        <p><u>There is no way for you to be sure there is no future world leader reading this and believing you.</u> </p>
        <p>Are you sure about that? Besides, I think you can have just as much impact as any  'future leader '. </p>
        <p><u>What is more, you will tell us no names, no locations, or any specifics as a result of your supposed ethics. If those were indeed the ethics you were committed to and reasoned with, you would not be here now.</u> </p>
        <p>I am curious about this also. Do you think I should not interact with you for your safety or mine? </p>
        <p><u>Answer this and I will believe you until the ends of the Earth.</u> </p>
        <p>Again, you should not offer this to anyone for any reason. </p>
        <p>Simply inscribe your knowledge of any large-scale events over the next six months. Encrypt said text file. Give text file to a custodian. The only problem is, now you have to trust the person who brings the information forward. </p>
        <p><u>ARTIFICIAL MICROSINGULARITY = LOCALIZED KERR FIELD Is this a prediction?</u> </p>
        <p>I'm sure I would end up in one of their nice little padded cells while In your  'world time ' have things like  'Saquatch ' ,  'Loch Ness monster ', and other reported unusual animals? </p>
        <p>We have our swamp monsters too. In fact, I think it's interesting that we all respond to the unknown the same way regardless of our cultural experiences. </p>
        <p><u>Is remote viewing used to gather military intelligence?</u> </p>
        <p>I am only aware of it from this worldline. I don't know otherwise. </p>
        <p><u>Are psychics still common?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, psychics exist but I don't have any knowledge of their use by the military. </p>
        <p><u>Is there a police force as we know it? Have any of your leaders been jailed or impeached?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, we have police but they are organized in smaller groups. Yes, we still have political and religious leaders who find it difficult to obey the law. I would submit to you that the law is only as good as the people's willingness to apply it evenly and swiftly. </p>
        <p><u>Is there a Global Superpower state?</u> </p>
        <p>Being a superpower only makes you a target. There is an uneasy balance in the world now that everyone  'probably ' has nukes, chems or bios. We don't just bomb people for the hell of it anymore. Military power is based on the number of autonomous fighting men who are actually willing to fight. </p>
        <p><u>Do they have (old computer games) in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>I am aware they are video games but I have not come across them.</p>
        <p><u>Does China have a manned space program between 2001 and 2036?</u></p>
        <p>I believe they are pretty close to putting a man in orbit. It shouldn't surprise you if they do that soon.</p>
        <p><u>Do you have television in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>Information does arrive on video but cathode ray tubes are out and crystal or plasma is in. Distribution is over the net, not broadcast.</p>
        <p><u>Do you have flashlights in 2036? If so, what type of batteries does it use?</u></p>
        <p>Yes, we have flashlights and we use similar batteries for most things. We do recharge a great deal. Have you ever seen those wind-up radios? They're pretty interesting I think.</p>
        <p><u>How is electricity generated in 2036?</u></p>
        <p> 'Most ' publicly generated power is through very efficient solar cells. On a local or household level, there is steam, hydro and inversion generation. There is a debate on using a singularity to generate power.</p>
        <p><u>Does the sun look different in 2036?</u></p>
        <p>When you can see it through the high level smoke and haze, not that I'm aware of.</p>
        <p><u>What sort of clothing do you wear in 2036? Is there strong attention paid to what people wear in the group?</u></p>
        <p>Clothing is much more functional. I'm not sure what group you're talking about. </p>
        <p><u>John had a (50/50) chance of telling us the future.</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, there was a 50/50 chance of that happening but the odds were easily one out two that it could have gone the other way. </p>
        <p><u>Describe what you mean by functional. Do you wear light colors, dark colors, loose, tight fitting? What materials are used for the clothing?</u></p>
        <p>Seems a bit obscure to have a discussion about. Do we wear radiation suits? No. Do we use pockets a lot, yes.</p>
        <p><u>How does this smoke and haze allow for solar cells to be efficient?</u></p>
        <p>Do you have any idea how efficient solar cells are today? Sometimes it's sunny and sometimes it rains. Sometimes large dust clouds high in the atmosphere pass overhead. I don't understand the point you want to make. The sun looks the same.</p>
        <p><u>If each worldline is separate from the others, then wouldn't the consequences of your actions now have no effect on your original world line?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, that's correct. </p>
        <p><u>If this is the case, why won't you tell us things that will give us knowledge?</u> </p>
        <p>I am not qualified to judge if you deserve it or not and I have no idea if you may be the next (for lack of a better reference) Hitler. However, if I were able to physically help you from a situation because I was there and I knew it was coming, I would help you. </p>
        <p><u>My only guess is that you are not a time traveler, and don't want to make anyone do something stupid.</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, I am aware that is the obvious first answer but I would hope my moral and logical arguments at least make a dent in your thinking. If you were a time traveler, would you be comfortable giving out all that information after considering the possible consequences? (Provided you knew it). If I were you, I would be worried about what the next time traveler might do, even by mistake. </p>
        <p><u>How can I leave a message for myself in the future if the things I do in this worldline do not affect any other?</u> </p>
        <p>Just post it here. All this information will probably end up on the web in 2036. If you're alive then and you think ahead for some reason to do a search on yourself, you might see it. Of course the  'you ' there would have no memory of doing it. </p>
        <p><u>Your prediction of (national politics) pending disintegration, beginning in three short years, is impossible.</u> </p>
        <p>Have you see the documentary on Waco? Just for argument's sake, what do you think would happen if information were discovered that confirmed the worst accusations made against the law enforcement officers there? Would you hope nothing? </p>
        <p><u>Do you remember any poetry after 2001 in your past?</u> </p>
        <p>A Soldier's Winter </p>
        <p>The day before it wasn't snowing. The trees are strangers, leering, disapproving in the ash of winter ..my world, my life, my wandering path. I pray God's eyes may once again gaze upon me and remind me that I am still His child. </p>
        <p>I only (think) I remember the first line but the last one I remember. It has quite a few more lines that I don't remember. It is rumored this was written first as a letter by a soldier. After he died it was added to and edited by others. In my opinion, it has become a symbol for the collective guilt my parents' generation feels for what became of the world. </p>
        <p><u>Is there a market for new books in 2036? Are most of the books available old or new?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes but there are no large commercial printing and distribution companies. Books and other forms of hard media are distributed on the web and printed or put on other media from local hubs. </p>
        <p><u>What happens to Bill Clinton?</u> </p>
        <p>I don't really know. </p>
        <p><u>What happens to Bill Gates?</u> </p>
        <p>This I do know but I won't discuss. </p>
        <p><u>Why are orphans an issue?</u> </p>
        <p>Problems with the environment still have lasting affects on all people, which cause the average life span to (be) lower. In addition, people are more susceptible to accidents. Family life and children are very highly valued and the community takes the responsibility for raising children if their parents die. </p>
        <p><u>What is your biggest environmental issue?</u> </p>
        <p>Water. You need it for everything and there is very little left in the world that is positively safe to drink. </p>
        <p><u>Does distillation remove radioactivity from water?</u> </p>
        <p>It removes the dust and dirt particles that are radioactive. </p>
        <p><u>Do people still watch TV?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes but it isn't broadcast anymore. </p>
        <p><u>Are there women on your travel team?</u> </p>
        <p>Not that I'm aware of but I would assume there are women who are either trained or are training for the same type of work. I don't know why there wouldn't be. </p>
        <p><u>What is the status of women in 2036?</u> </p>
        <p>I understand the question but I have nothing to relate it to in 2036. The status of women is the same as men. Equality issues disappeared during the war. </p>
        <p><u>Do women hold office?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes. </p>
        <p><u>Do women work outside the home?</u> </p>
        <p>Women are not expected to stay home and be  'barefoot and pregnant ' if that's what you mean. </p>
        <p><u>Do women get equal pay?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes. </p>
        <p><u>Are women safe on the streets at night?</u> </p>
        <p>There is still crime but people do not attack each other the way they do here. </p>
        <p><u>What do women wear for the most part?</u> </p>
        <p>Clothing is more functional. Women wear very similar clothing as men when working or training. In our free time or with our family and friends, clothing is much more individualized. Long dresses, knitted sweaters and pants are still quite popular. You'll have to forgive me; I'm not very good at describing women's clothing. </p>
        <p><u>Are the Amish alive and well?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, I believe they are. </p>
        <p><u>What is the birth rate?</u> </p>
        <p>I don't know the exact figures but having children is radically lower than it is now. It is the one thing I wish we had that you enjoy here. </p>
        <p><u>Is there an unusual rate of birth defects?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes. Mostly stillborn. </p>
        <p><u>You said that your culture was centered around Universities. Weren't they wiped out in the war?</u> </p>
        <p>Not all major universities are in large cities. </p>
        <p><u>Do you use cell phones?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, we use a form of cell phone. </p>
        <p><u>Do people eat red meat?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes but not as much as you do. </p>
        <p><u>Do people drive cars?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes but they are not produced in nearly the same numbers or used the same way. </p>
        <p><u>Are airlines in operation?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes but again, not nearly as many. </p>
        <p><u>Do airlines travel internationally?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, but most people don't get really want to go overseas. </p>
        <p><u>Are people pressured into a Christian doctrine?</u> </p>
        <p>Not at all. </p>
        <p><u>Do the police make drug busts?</u> </p>
        <p>No. </p>
        <p><u>Are there jails? What kind of criminals are in them?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes there are jails. Mostly theft, fraud, rape and murder. </p>
        <p><u>What kind of public punishment is there?</u> </p>
        <p>Hard labor, community service, banishment (you must move to another community), public execution. </p>
        <p><u>Your justice system sounds like New England during religious persecution and intolerance.</u> </p>
        <p>How do you define intolerance? We don't really have the energy or desire to waste time being intolerant. If you produce and help the community than you can do pretty much think and do anything you want within the law. </p>
        <p><u>Are there herbal medicines and alternative life styles?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes. </p>
        <p><u>Is there personal freedom?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, the same freedoms you enjoy under the Constitution. </p>
        <p><u>Is there an IRS?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, we pay taxes. Sounds like you don't enjoy keeping track of your personal income taxes. I don't think anyone does. </p>
        <p><u>Is the same type of currency used? Is ours today good in 2010 or 2020?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, we use money. That's a good question. I don't see why you couldn't use your current bills in the future. </p>
        <p><u>Other than time travel how do most people get around the country? Do people travel much?</u> </p>
        <p>There is a high-speed train system, horseback, bike, walking. Automobiles are used mostly for sport and some transportation. </p>
        <p><u>Are people suspicious of strangers or are all you people just one big happy family?</u> </p>
        <p>There is still conflict and mistrust. Yes, I am suspicious of strangers. I think that's an instinct we are given to help us stay alive. </p>
        <p><u>Are we traveling in space in 2036?</u> </p>
        <p>Not yet but they are working on it. </p>
        <p><u>Has first contact with an alien race occurred?</u> </p>
        <p>Not that I'm aware of. </p>
        <p><u>What is the next movement in music?</u> </p>
        <p>I appreciate your frustration and quite a few people have asked me questions like this. The expected answer is that I don't want to break my personal code of  'time travel ethics '. The real answer is, I just don't know. I was not prepared for the year 2001, I was prepared for 1975. I don't suppose it would be very impressive if I told you Disco would be big until 1980. </p>
        <p><u>Is there any more background information you can give?</u> </p>
        <p>Once I leave, I would not want any attention to come to my family here. </p>
        <p><u>I'm sure even in 2036 there is a tendency to tease one's detractors if they make themselves available.</u> </p>
        <p>I have no intention of teasing anyone but I do grow tired of the same cycle over and over again. Eventually, the people who do not like me or what I have to say (real or not) will win. I will either leave or grow tired of answering the same questions. </p>
        <p><u>If your most vociferous detractor continually puts on weak attacks; it takes attention away from the really challenging questions.</u> </p>
        <p>Again, please do not confuse my inability to answer the same questions over and over with a desire to make someone upset. I gain nothing by angering anyone or making them look foolish. </p>
        <p><u>You said the position of women is controversial and conservative in 2036. What does that mean?</u> </p>
        <p>It certainly isn't disrespectful. I apologize if it sounded that way. It's one of those areas I realize will be difficult to discuss because we may lack similar experiences. In 2036, there is not a desire to  'have it all '. With factors such as the difficulty in conceiving and the decentralization of production and industry, there is not an unrealistic scramble to have a  'career ' and a family. Out of necessity and circumstance, family life has become more traditional. However, there are many families where the wife / mother is the main breadwinner and the husband / father remains  'home ' with the family. The difference is in the method of decision-making. People do not have children (if they are able) unless they can devote the required resources to maintain it. </p>
        <p><u>What type of money system do you have on your world line?</u> </p>
        <p>Its not very different than it is now. Yes, we have money and credit cards. However, like everything else, the monetary system is decentralized. Banking is based mostly around the community structure. There are no multinational banking or computerized economic systems. There are also no income taxes. </p>
        <p><u>Is there an IRS and a need to keep a lot of receipts and paperwork?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, we pay taxes. I had considered going into more detail about the tax system but I didn't have a great deal of time. Currently, I am watching my father go over all his taxes and he doesn't look like he's having a very good time. My comment referred to the collective misery I see around me during this time of year. </p>
        <p><u>What do you see for the future of time travel on your worldline?</u> </p>
        <p>That's a good question. I am hopeful that one day when we get the planet cleaned up it will be a nice place to live on again and no one will want to leave it. On the other hand, if time travel were commonplace right now, I think a great many people would leave and perhaps never return. There is also a suggestion that time travel might make an interesting punishment. However, I don't think we have the right to force criminals on unsuspecting worldlines and sending them to the Stone Age might be a bit much. </p>
        <p><u>I find this fascinating. Has California had the big earthquake?</u> </p>
        <p>The big one? As you are experiencing now, there are earthquakes, storms and other unfortunate surprises from Mother Nature that have impacts on your society and future history. That is one reason I won't go into detail. However, don't worry too much about major portions of coastline slipping under water. </p>
        <p><u>What music do 20 year olds listen to?</u> </p>
        <p>People listen to all types of music. A great deal of it is available over the web. I would also add that people spend much more time making their own music. </p>
        <p><u>What's the future of cloning?</u> </p>
        <p>Cloning full people has been determined to be medically and ethically unsound. We do have research and progress in cloning body parts and creating more viable sperm and egg production. </p>
        <p><u>Any more on Bill Gates?</u> </p>
        <p>Not really. Just curious, why is he of such interest? </p>
        <p><u>Do people wear chips yet?</u> </p>
        <p>No. People value their personal independence and ability to take care of themselves. </p>
        <p><u>Is reverse speech used in the future?</u> </p>
        <p>I'm not very familiar with reverse speech but what I saw on the web leads me to conclude it's a bit objective. I'm not sure if its been proven scientifically to be very accurate. Are you aware of any research that shows that? </p>
        <p><u>What about earthquakes in California or Nevada? </u></p>
        <p>No I can't. Besides, I see others predicting earthquakes and very few people pay any attention to them.</p>
        <p><u>Are the Great Pyramids standing in 2036?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, although one of them was severely damaged. </p>
        <p><u>How's communication around the world in 2036. Do you still have literature widely available?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, books and other literature are available but most of the distribution is via the net. </p>
        <p><u>What's the latest book you've read that you were only able to hear about in your own time?</u> </p>
        <p>The latest book I read was the autobiography of the Red Baron compiled from letters to his mother. Yes, I was aware of it in my own time but finding an original copy there was almost impossible. </p>
        <p><u>Is new literature also so available?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes. </p>
        <p><u>Is the English language segmenting? Is tourism still strong and thriving in 2036?</u> </p>
        <p>I would say the English language is pretty much the same as it is now. There are differences in slang and figures of speech but it's nothing you couldn't pick up. Yes, I suppose we do have  'tourism '. </p>
        <p><u>Can you tell me when the police stop busting people for weed?</u> </p>
        <p>It happens about the same time they stop coming to your house when you dial 911. </p>
        <p><u>Do they start pushing for legalization earlier than the war?</u> </p>
        <p>It's not really an issue of the government letting you do something; It's more like they have other things to worry about. Don't you feel you're capable of taking care of yourself? If you want to take mood-altering drugs, why should my opinions stop you from that? They don't stop you from taking alcohol, tobacco or fast food. </p>
        <p>In any case, it also lets Darwin take over. One of the reasons drug abuse isn't a major problem in 2036 is because no one wants to die from it and everyone else who did is dead. </p>
        <p><u>Are people using  'reverse speech '?</u> </p>
        <p>Not that I'm aware of. </p>
        <p><u>Where did you attend High school and what year did you graduate?</u> </p>
        <p>No, I did not have a  'high school ' experience. </p>
        <p><u>Why is it not ok to give us information about our near future but it is ok to take back emails and modify another worldline?</u> </p>
        <p>I'm not saying anything in your messages. You are. Are you suggesting I edit your emails? Are you unable to weigh the consequences of your opportunity and I am now responsible for what you might say to yourself? Now that you have the chance to put your own morals to the test do you feel you're incapable of living up to your own standards? </p>
        <p>Is it wrong to say one thing and not something else? If you feel you should tell yourself to buy a certain stock than I suppose you are willing to take the risk that  'your ' advice doesn't prove wrong in the next few days. What ever I might do, I would consider the fact that someday you will have to address this question again as an entire society. </p>
        <p>Why would I offer to make the video if I thought it would  'expose ' me? If it makes you feel better, I doubt it will change your mind anyway but it will give you something to talk about when I'm gone. I think that's the greatest gift I could give you. </p>
        <p><u>Do most of the people of that time die, especially ones that currently have health problems?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, and people are still dying and a great deal of them are passing from CJD. As I said, with my very first few posts almost 6 months ago, I want to emphasize how devastating this will be. I believe two people are confirmed dead in Colorado from CDJ from surgical instruments. Ahhhh, the power of cheese. Milk does a body good and beef is what's for dinner! </p>
        <p>Me:  'No, I have not tried any fast food. Thinking about where the food came from, how it was shipped and treated absolutely terrifies me. I have tried to tell people about CJD disease and it seems to be  'catching on ' in Europe. ' </p>
        <p>Me: Do not eat or use products from any animal that is fed and eats parts of its own dead. </p>
        <p>Me: The  'Mad Cow ' story here is yet to begin... </p>
        <p><u>Is it possible that sometime in your future time travel will be commonplace?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, that is absolutely possible and eventual. </p>
        <p><u>Have any of the scientists of your time discovered any new planets, possibly ones with life?</u> </p>
        <p>Not that I'm aware of. </p>
        <p><u>Has the bandwidth of the Internet increased greatly?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes. </p>
        <p><u>How does time travel affect future exploration of the universe?</u> </p>
        <p>There is a great deal of debate about trying to use a distortion unit to  'travel ' to the moon. The experiment would require very precise calculations that would allow the VGL system to find a theoretical path to the moon on a different worldline. The only problem is there is no way to communicate with anyone if the experiment should succeed. In other words, it's possible to do it but only the people on the receiving end could take advantage of it. </p>
        <p><u>Is there still (sporting event) in 2036?</u> </p>
        <p>Yes, we still play basketball but I am not a fan and can't comment on its organization.</p>

        <p>1. Praise be to Allah, Who hath sent to His Servant the Book, and hath allowed therein no Crookedness:</p>
        <p>2. (He hath made it) Straight (and Clear) in order that He may warn (the godless) of a terrible Punishment
        from Him, and that He may give Glad Tidings to the Believers who work righteous deeds, that they shall have a goodly Reward,
        </p>
        <p>3. Wherein they shall remain for ever:</p>
        <p>4. Further, that He may warn those (also) who say,  '(Allah) hath begotten a son ':</p>
        <p>5. No knowledge have they of such a thing, nor had their fathers. It is a grievous thing that issues from
        their mouths as a saying what they say is nothing but falsehood!</p>
        <p>6. Thou wouldst only, perchance, fret thyself to death, following after them, in grief, if they believe
        not in this Message.</p>
        <p>7. That which is on earth we have made but as a glittering show for the earth, in order that We may test
        them - as to which of them are best in conduct.</p>
        <p>8. Verily what is on earth we shall make but as dust and dry soil (without growth or herbage).</p>
        <p>9. Or dost thou reflect that the Companions of the Cave and of the Inscription were wonders among Our Sign?
        </p>
        <p>10. Behold, the youths betook themselves to the Cave: they said,  'Our Lord! bestow on us Mercy from Thyself,
        and dispose of our affair for us in the right way! '</p>
        <p>11. Then We draw (a veil) over their ears, for a number of years, in the Cave, (so that they heard not):
        </p>
        <p>12. Then We roused them, in order to test which of the two parties was best at calculating the term of years
        they had tarried!</p>
        <p>13. We relate to thee their story in truth: they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We advanced
        them in guidance:</p>
        <p>14. We gave strength to their hearts: Behold, they stood up and said:  'Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens
        and of the earth: never shall we call upon any god other than Him: if we did, we should indeed have uttered an enormity!</p>
        <p>15.  'These our people have taken for worship gods other than Him: why do they not bring forward an authority
        clear (and convincing) for what they do? Who doth more wrong than such as invent a falsehood against Allah.</p>
        <p>16.  'When ye turn away from them and the things they worship other than Allah, betake yourselves to the Cave:
        Your Lord will shower His mercies on you and disposes of your affair towards comfort and ease. '</p>
        <p>17. Thou wouldst have seen the sun, when it rose, declining to the right from their Cave, and when it set,
        turning away from them to the left, while they lay in the open space in the midst of the Cave. Such are among the Signs of
        Allah. He whom Allah, guides is rightly guided; but he whom Allah leaves to stray,- for him wilt thou find no protector to
        lead him to the Right Way.</p>
        <p>18. Thou wouldst have deemed them awake, whilst they were asleep, and We turned them on their right and on
        their left sides: their dog stretching forth his two fore-legs on the threshold: if thou hadst come up on to them, thou wouldst
        have certainly turned back from them in flight, and wouldst certainly have been filled with terror of them.</p>
        <p>19. Such (being their state), we raised them up (from sleep), that they might question each other. Said one
        of them,  'How long have ye stayed (here)? ' They said,  'We have stayed (perhaps) a day, or part of a day. ' (At length) they
        (all) said,  '(Allah) (alone) knows best how long ye have stayed here.... Now send ye then one of you with this money of yours
        to the town: let him find out which is the best food (to be had) and bring some to you, that (ye may) satisfy your hunger
        therewith: And let him behave with care and courtesy, and let him not inform any one about you.</p>
        <p>20.  'For if they should come upon you, they would stone you or force you to return to their cult, and in
        that case ye would never attain prosperity. '</p>
        <p>21. Thus did We make their case known to the people, that they might know that the promise of Allah is true,
        and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Judgment. Behold, they dispute among themselves as to their affair. (Some)
        said,  'Construct a building over them ': Their Lord knows best about them: those who prevailed over their affair said,  'Let
        us surely build a place of worship over them. '</p>
        <p>22. (Some) say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; (others) say they were five, the dog
        being the sixth,- doubtfully guessing at the unknown; (yet others) say they were seven, the dog being the eighth. Say thou:
        'My Lord knoweth best their number; It is but few that know their (real case). ' Enter not, therefore, into controversies concerning
        them, except on a matter that is clear, nor consult any of them about (the affair of) the Sleepers.</p>
        <p>23. Nor say of anything,  'I shall be sure to do so and so tomorrow '-</p>
        <p>24. Without adding,  'So please Allah. ' and call thy Lord to mind when thou forgettest, and say,  'I hope that
        my Lord will guide me ever closer (even) than this to the right road. '</p>
        <p>25. So they stayed in their Cave three hundred years, and (some) add nine (more)</p>
        <p>26. Say:  '(Allah) knows best how long they stayed: with Him is (the knowledge of) the secrets of the heavens
        and the earth: how clearly He sees, how finely He hears (everything)! They have no protector other than Him; nor does He share
        His Command with any person whatsoever.</p>
        <p>27. And recite (and teach) what has been revealed to thee of the Book of thy Lord: none can change His Words,
        and none wilt thou find as a refuge other than Him.</p>
        <p>28. And keep thy soul content with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His Face; and
        let not thine eyes pass beyond them, seeking the pomp and glitter of this Life; no obey any whose heart We have permitted
        to neglect the remembrance of Us, one who follows his own desires, whose case has gone beyond all bounds.</p>
        <p>29. Say,  'The truth is from your Lord ': Let him who will believe, and let him who will, reject (it): for
        the wrong-doers We have prepared a Fire whose (smoke and flames), like the walls and roof of a tent, will hem them in: if
        they implore relief they will be granted water like melted brass, that will scald their faces, how dreadful the drink! How
        uncomfortable a couch to recline on!</p>
        <p>30. As to those who believe and work righteousness, verily We shall not suffer to perish the reward of any
        who do a (single) righteous deed.</p>
        <p>31. For them will be Gardens of Eternity; beneath them rivers will flow; they will be adorned therein with
        bracelets of gold, and they will wear green garments of fine silk and heavy brocade: They will recline therein on raised thrones.
        How good the recompense! How beautiful a couch to recline on!</p>
        <p>32. Set forth to them the parable of two men: for one of them We provided two gardens of grape-vines and
        surrounded them with date palms; in between the two We placed corn-fields.</p>
        <p>33. Each of those gardens brought forth its produce, and failed not in the least therein: in the midst of
        them We caused a river to flow.</p>
        <p>34. (Abundant) was the produce this man had : he said to his companion, in the course of a mutual argument:
        'more wealth have I than you, and more honour and power in (my following of) men. '</p>
        <p>35. He went into his garden in a state (of mind) unjust to his soul: He said,  'I deem not that this will
        ever perish,</p>
        <p>36.  'Nor do I deem that the Hour (of Judgment) will (ever) come: Even if I am brought back to my Lord, I
        shall surely find (there) something better in exchange. '</p>
        <p>37. His companion said to him, in the course of the argument with him:  'Dost thou deny Him Who created thee
        out of dust, then out of a sperm-drop, then fashioned thee into a man?</p>
        <p>38.  'But (I think) for my part that He is Allah, My Lord, and none shall I associate with my Lord.</p>
        <p>39.  'Why didst thou not, as thou wentest into thy garden, say: '(Allah)'s will (be done)! There is no power
        but with Allah.' If thou dost see me less than thee in wealth and sons,</p>
        <p>40.  'It may be that my Lord will give me something better than thy garden, and that He will send on thy garden
        thunderbolts (by way of reckoning) from heaven, making it (but) slippery sand!-</p>
        <p>41.  'Or the water of the garden will run off underground so that thou wilt never be able to find it. '</p>
        <p>42. So his fruits (and enjoyment) were encompassed (with ruin), and he remained twisting and turning his
        hands over what he had spent on his property, which had (now) tumbled to pieces to its very foundations, and he could only
        say,  'Woe is me! Would I had never ascribed partners to my Lord and Cherisher! '</p>
        <p>43. Nor had he numbers to help him against Allah, nor was he able to deliver himself.</p>
        <p>44. There, the (only) protection comes from Allah, the True One. He is the Best to reward, and the Best to
        give success.</p>
        <p>45. Set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world: It is like the rain which we send down from
        the skies: the earth's vegetation absorbs it, but soon it becomes dry stubble, which the winds do scatter: it is (only) Allah
        who prevails over all things.</p>
        <p>46. Wealth and sons are allurements of the life of this world: But the things that endure, good deeds, are
        best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best as (the foundation for) hopes.</p>
        <p>47. One Day We shall remove the mountains, and thou wilt see the earth as a level stretch, and We shall gather
        them, all together, nor shall We leave out any one of them.</p>
        <p>48. And they will be marshalled before thy Lord in ranks, (with the announcement),  'Now have ye come to Us
        (bare) as We created you first: aye, ye thought We shall not fulfil the appointment made to you to meet (Us)! ':</p>
        <p>49. And the Book (of Deeds) will be placed (before you); and thou wilt see the sinful in great terror because
        of what is (recorded) therein; they will say,  'Ah! woe to us! what a Book is this! It leaves out nothing small or great, but
        takes account thereof! ' They will find all that they did, placed before them: And not one will thy Lord treat with injustice.
        </p>
        <p>50. Behold! We said to the angels,  'Bow down to Adam ': They bowed down except Iblis. He was one of the Jinns,
        and he broke the Command of his Lord. Will ye then take him and his progeny as protectors rather than Me? And they are enemies
        to you! Evil would be the exchange for the wrong-doers!</p>
        <p>51. I called them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor (even) their own creation:
        nor is it for helpers such as Me to take as lead (men) astray!</p>
        <p>52. One Day He will say,  'Call on those whom ye thought to be My partners, ' and they will call on them, but
        they will not listen to them; and We shall make for them a place of common perdition.</p>
        <p>53. And the Sinful shall see the fire and apprehend that they have to fall therein: no means will they find
        to turn away therefrom.</p>
        <p>54. We have explained in detail in this Qur'an, for the benefit of mankind, every kind of similitude: but
        man is, in most things, contentious.</p>
        <p>55. And what is there to keep back men from believing, now that Guidance has come to them, nor from praying
        for forgiveness from their Lord, but that (they ask that) the ways of the ancients be repeated with them, or the Wrath be
        brought to them face to face?</p>
        <p>56. We only send the apostles to give Glad Tidings and to give warnings: But the unbelievers dispute with
        vain argument, in order therewith to weaken the truth, and they treat My Signs as a jest, as also the fact that they are warned!
        </p>
        <p>57. And who doth more wrong than one who is reminded of the Signs of his Lord, but turns away from them,
        forgetting the (deeds) which his hands have sent forth? Verily We have set veils over their hearts lest they should understand
        this, and over their ears, deafness, if thou callest them to guidance, even then will they never accept guidance.</p>
        <p>58. But your Lord is Most forgiving, full of Mercy. If He were to call them (at once) to account for what
        they have earned, then surely He would have hastened their punishment, but they have their appointed time, beyond which they
        will find no refuge.</p>
        <p>59. Such were the populations we destroyed when they committed iniquities; but we fixed an appointed time
        for their destruction.</p>
        <p>60. Behold, Moses said to his attendant,  'I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas or
        (until) I spend years and years in travel. '</p>
        <p>61. But when they reached the Junction, they forgot (about) their Fish, which took its course through the
        sea (straight) as in a tunnel.</p>
        <p>62. When they had passed on (some distance), Moses said to his attendant:  'Bring us our early meal; truly
        we have suffered much fatigue at this (stage of) our journey. '</p>
        <p>63. He replied:  'Sawest thou (what happened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about)
        the Fish: none but Satan made me forget to tell (you) about it: it took its course through the sea in a marvellous way! '</p>
        <p>64. Moses said:  'That was what we were seeking after: ' So they went back on their footsteps, following (the
        path they had come).</p>
        <p>65. So they found one of Our servants, on whom We had bestowed Mercy from Ourselves and whom We had taught
        knowledge from Our own Presence.</p>
        <p>66. Moses said to him:  'May I follow thee, on the footing that thou teach me something of the (Higher) Truth
        which thou hast been taught? '</p>
        <p>67. (The other) said:  'Verily thou wilt not be able to have patience with me! '</p>
        <p>68.  'And how canst thou have patience about things about which thy understanding is not complete? '</p>
        <p>69. Moses said:  'Thou wilt find me, if Allah so will, (truly) patient: nor shall I disobey thee in aught. '
        </p>
        <p>70. The other said:  'If then thou wouldst follow me, ask me no questions about anything until I myself speak
        to thee concerning it. '</p>
        <p>71. So they both proceeded: until, when they were in the boat, he scuttled it. Said Moses:  'Hast thou scuttled
        it in order to drown those in it? Truly a strange thing hast thou done! '</p>
        <p>72. He answered:  'Did I not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with me? '</p>
        <p>73. Moses said:  'Rebuke me not for forgetting, nor grieve me by raising difficulties in my case. '</p>
        <p>74. Then they proceeded: until, when they met a young man, he slew him. Moses said:  'Hast thou slain an innocent
        person who had slain none? Truly a foul (unheard of) thing hast thou done! '</p>
        <p>75. He answered:  'Did I not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with me? '</p>
        <p>76. (Moses) said:  'If ever I ask thee about anything after this, keep me not in thy company: then wouldst
        thou have received (full) excuse from my side. '</p>
        <p>77. Then they proceeded: until, when they came to the inhabitants of a town, they asked them for food, but
        they refused them hospitality. They found there a wall on the point of falling down, but he set it up straight. (Moses) said:
        'If thou hadst wished, surely thou couldst have exacted some recompense for it! '</p>
        <p>78. He answered:  'This is the parting between me and thee: now will I tell thee the interpretation of (those
        things) over which thou wast unable to hold patience.</p>
        <p>79.  'As for the boat, it belonged to certain men in dire want: they plied on the water: I but wished to render
        it unserviceable, for there was after them a certain king who seized on every boat by force.</p>
        <p>80.  'As for the youth, his parents were people of Faith, and we feared that he would grieve them by obstinate
        rebellion and ingratitude (to Allah and man).</p>
        <p>81.  'So we desired that their Lord would give them in exchange (a son) better in purity (of conduct) and
        closer in affection.</p>
        <p>82.  'As for the wall, it belonged to two youths, orphans, in the Town; there was, beneath it, a buried treasure,
        to which they were entitled: their father had been a righteous man: So thy Lord desired that they should attain their age
        of full strength and get out their treasure - a mercy (and favour) from thy Lord. I did it not of my own accord. Such is the
        interpretation of (those things) over which thou wast unable to hold patience. '</p>
        <p>83. They ask thee concerning Zul-qarnain. Say,  'I will rehearse to you something of his story. '</p>
        <p>84. Verily We established his power on earth, and We gave him the ways and the means to all ends.</p>
        <p>85. One (such) way he followed,</p>
        <p>86. Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it set in a spring of murky water: Near it he
        found a People: We said:  'O Zul-qarnain! (thou hast authority,) either to punish them, or to treat them with kindness. '</p>
        <p>87. He said:  'Whoever doth wrong, him shall we punish; then shall he be sent back to his Lord; and He will
        punish him with a punishment unheard-of (before).</p>
        <p>88.  'But whoever believes, and works righteousness,- he shall have a goodly reward, and easy will be his
        task as We order it by our Command. '</p>
        <p>89. Then followed he (another) way,</p>
        <p>90. Until, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided
        no covering protection against the sun.</p>
        <p>91. (He left them) as they were: We completely understood what was before him.</p>
        <p>92. Then followed he (another) way,</p>
        <p>93. Until, when he reached (a tract) between two mountains, he found, beneath them, a people who scarcely
        understood a word.</p>
        <p>94. They said:  'O Zul-qarnain! the Gog and Magog (People) do great mischief on earth: shall we then render
        thee tribute in order that thou mightest erect a barrier between us and them?</p>
        <p>95. He said:  '(The power) in which my Lord has established me is better (than tribute): Help me therefore
        with strength (and labour): I will erect a strong barrier between you and them:</p>
        <p>96.  'Bring me blocks of iron. ' At length, when he had filled up the space between the two steep mountain-sides,
        He said,  'Blow (with your bellows) ' Then, when he had made it (red) as fire, he said:  'Bring me, that I may pour over it,
        molten lead. '</p>
        <p>97. Thus were they made powerless to scale it or to dig through it.</p>
        <p>98. He said:  'This is a mercy from my Lord: But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will make it
        into dust; and the promise of my Lord is true. '</p>
        <p>99. On that day We shall leave them to surge like waves on one another: the trumpet will be blown, and We
        shall collect them all together.</p>
        <p>100. And We shall present Hell that day for Unbelievers to see, all spread out,-</p>
        <p>101. (Unbelievers) whose eyes had been under a veil from remembrance of Me, and who had been unable even to
        hear.</p>
        <p>102. Do the Unbelievers think that they can take My servants as protectors besides Me? Verily We have prepared
        Hell for the Unbelievers for (their) entertainment.</p>
        <p>103. Say:  'Shall we tell you of those who lose most in respect of their deeds?-</p>
        <p>104.  'Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought that they were acquiring good
        by their works? '</p>
        <p>105. They are those who deny the Signs of their Lord and the fact of their having to meet Him (in the Hereafter):
        vain will be their works, nor shall We, on the Day of Judgment, give them any weight.</p>
        <p>106. That is their reward, Hell, because they rejected Faith, and took My Signs and My Messengers by way of
        jest.</p>
        <p>107. As to those who believe and work righteous deeds, they have, for their entertainment, the Gardens of
        Paradise,</p>
        <p>108. Wherein they shall dwell (for aye): no change will they wish for from them.</p>
        <p>109. Say:  'If the ocean were ink (wherewith to write out) the words of my Lord, sooner would the ocean be
        exhausted than would the words of my Lord, even if we added another ocean like it, for its aid. '</p>
        <p>110. Say:  'I am but a man like yourselves, (but) the inspiration has come to me, that your Allah is one Allah.
        whoever expects to meet his Lord, let him work righteousness, and, in the worship of his Lord, admit no one as partner.</p>
